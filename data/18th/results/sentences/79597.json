        "B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading.",
        "Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind;",
        "and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation.",
        "The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only",
        "the",
        "lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement",
        ".",
        "At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn.",
        "This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion.",
        "If it",
        "is filled with nonsense, that nonsense at any rate is innocent.",
        "It is modest, cleanly and without malice or irreverence.",
        "A worthier and nobler work might have been written; a purer work could not have been.",
        "What its other merits are he who reads it will discern.",
        "To apologize for it in any manner would be to admit that it has grave deficiencies, and such an admission the author would not make even if his conscience impelled him to do so.",
        "The book is offered to the reader with the conviction that if the man who laughs is the happiest man, it may contribute something to the sum of human felicity.",
        "The story of the French horn, related in the twentieth chapter, will recall to the reader of the \"Sparrowgrass Papers\" an incident related in that most charming book of humor.",
        "Perhaps it ought to be said that the former narrative was at least suggested by the latter.",
        "The artist who has illustrated the book, Mr. Arthur B. Frost, deserves to have it said of him that he has done his work skilfully, tastefully and with nice appreciation of the humor of the various situations.",

        "_THE ADVANTAGES OF ELBOW-ROOM_.",
        "The professors of sociology, in exploring the mysteries of the science of human living, have not agreed that elbow-room is one of the great needs of modern civilized society, but this may be because they have not yet reached the bottom of things and discovered the truth.",
        "In crowded communities men have chances of development in certain directions, but in others their growth is surely checked.",
        "A man who lives in a large city is apt to experience a sharpening of his wits, for attrition of minds as well as of pebbles produces polish and brilliancy; but perhaps this very process prevents the free unfolding of parts of his character.",
        "If his individuality is not partially lost amid",
        "the crowd, it is likely that, first, his imitative faculty will induce",
        "him",
        "to shape himself in accordance with another than his own pattern, and that, second, the dread of the conspicuousness which is the certain result of eccentricity will persuade him to avoid any tendency he may have to become strongly unlike his neighbors.",
        "The house that he lives in is tightly squeezed in a row of dwellings builded upon a precisely similar plan, so that the influence brought to bear upon him by the home resembles to some extent",
        "that which operates upon his fellows.",
        "There is a pressure upon both",
        "sides of him in the house;",
        "and when he plunges into business, there is a far greater pressure there, in the shape of sharp competition, which brings him into constant collision with other men, and mayhap drives him or compels him to drive his weaker rival to the wall.",
        "The city-man is likely",
        "to",
        "cover himself with a mantle of reserve and dissimulation.",
        "If he has a longing to wander in untrodden and devious paths, he is disposed resolutely to suppress his desire and to go in the beaten track.",
        "If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith.",
        "And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example.",
        "In smaller and less densely-populated communities the weight of public opinion is not largely decreased, but the pressure is not so great.",
        "There is more elbow-room.",
        "A man who knows everybody about him gauges with a reasonable degree of accuracy the characters of those who are to judge him, and is able to form a pretty fair estimate of the value of their opinions.",
        "When men can do this, they are apt to feel a greater degree of freedom in following their natural impulses.",
        "If men could sound the depths of all knowledge and read with ease the secrets of the universe, they might lose much of their reverence.",
        "When they know the exact worth of the judgment of their fellow-men, they begin to regard it with comparative indifference.",
        "And so, if a dweller in a small village desires to leave the beaten track, he can summon courage to do so with greater readiness",
        "than",
        "the",
        "man of",
        "the",
        "town",
        ".",
        "If he has occasionally that proneness to make a fool of himself",
        "which seizes every man now and then, he may indulge in the perilous luxury without great carefulness of the consequences",
        ".",
        "Smith",
        "'s ordinary conduct is the admiration of Jones as a regular thing; but when Smith switches off into some eccentricity for which Jones has no inclination, it is only a matter of course that Jones should indulge in his own little oddities without caring whether Smith smiles upon him or not.",
        "It is, therefore, in such communities that search can most profitably be made for raw human nature that has had room to grow upon every side with little check or hindrance.",
        "The man who chooses to seek may find original characters, queer combinations of events, surprising revelations of individual and family experiences and an unlimited fund of amusement, especially if he is disposed, perhaps even while he submits to an overpowering conviction that all life is tragic, to summon into prominence those humorous phases of social existence which, as in the best of artificial tragedies, are permitted to appear in real life as the foil of that which is truly sorrowful.",
        "To depict events that are simply amusing may not be the highest and best function of a writer; but if he has a strong impulse to undertake such a task in the intervals of more serious work, it may be that he performs a duty which is more obvious because the common inclination of those who tell the story of human life is to present that which is sad and terrible, and to lead-the reader, whose soul has bitterness enough of its own, into contemplation of the true or fictitious anguish of others.",
        "At any rate, an attempt to show men and their actions in a purely humorous aspect is justified by the facts of human life; and if fiction is, for the most part, tragedy, there is reason why much of the remainder should be devoted to fun.",
        "To laugh is to perform as divine a function as to weep.",
        "Man, who was made only a little lower than the angels, is the only animal to whom laughter is permitted.",
        "He is the sole earthly heir of immortality, and he laughs.",
        "More than this, the process is healthful to both mind and body, for it is the man who laughs with reason and judgment who is the kindly, pure, cheerful and happy man.",
        "It is in a village wherein there is elbow-room for the physical and intellectual man that the characters in this book may be supposed to be, to do and to suffer.",
        "It would be unfair to say that the reader can visit the spot and meet face to face all these",
        "people who appear in the incidents herein recorded, and it would be equally improper",
        "to",
        "assert that there",
        "is naught written of them but veritable history.",
        "But it might perhaps be urged that",
        "the individuals exist in less decided and grotesque forms, and that the words and deeds attributed to them are less than wholly improbable.",
        "And if any one shall consider it",
        "worth while to inquire further concerning the matter, let him discover where may be found a community which exists in such a locality as this that I will now describe.",
        "A hamlet set upon a hillside.",
        "The top a breezy elevation crowned with foliage and commanding a view of matchless beauty.",
        "To the west, beneath, a sea of verdure rolling away in mighty billows, which here bear upon their crests a tiny wood, a diminutive dwelling, a flock of sheep or a drove of cattle, and there sweep apparently almost over a shadowy town which nestles between two of the emerald waves.",
        "Far, far beyond the steeples which rise dimly from the distant town a range of hills; beyond it still, a faint film of blue, the indistinct and misty semblance of towering mountains.",
        "To the north a lovely plain that rises a few miles away into a long low ridge which forms the sharp and clear horizon.",
        "To the south and east a narrow valley that is little more than a deep ravine, the sides of the precipitous hills covered with forest to the brink of the stream, which twists and turns at sharp angles like a wounded snake, shining as burnished silver",
        "when one",
        "catches glimpses",
        "of it through the trees, and playing an important",
        "part in a landscape which at brief distance seems as wild and as unconscious of the presence of man as if it were a part of the wilderness of Oregon rather than",
        "the",
        "adjunct",
        "of",
        "a busy town which feels continually",
        "the stir",
        "and",
        "impulse of",
        "the",
        "huge",
        "city only a dozen miles away",
        ".",
        "He who descends from the top of the village hill will pass pretty mansions set apart from their neighbors in leafy and flowery solitudes wherein the most unsocial hermit might find elbow-room enough; he will see little cottages",
        "which stand nearer to the roadside, as if they shunned isolation and wished to share in the life that often fills the highway in front of them",
        ".",
        "Farther down the houses become more companionable;",
        "they cling together in groups with the barest possibility of retaining",
        "their individuality, until at last the thoroughfare becomes a street wherein small shops do their traffic in quite a spirited sort of a way.",
        "Clear down at the foot of the hill, by the brink of the sweet and placid river, there are iron mills and factories and furnaces,",
        "whose chimneys in",
        "the",
        "daytime",
        "pour",
        "out",
        "huge columns",
        "of",
        "black",
        "smoke, and from",
        "which long tongues of crimson and bluish flame leap forth at night against the pitchy darkness of the sky.",
        "Here, as one whirls by in the train after nightfall, he may catch hurried glimpses of swarthy men, stripped to the waist, stirring the molten iron with their long levers or standing amid showers of sparks as the brilliant metal slips to and fro among the rollers that mould",
        "it into the",
        "forms",
        "of",
        "commerce.",
        "If upon a summer evening one shall rest amid the sweet air and the rustling trees upon the hill-top, he may hear coming up from this dusky, grimy blackness of the mills and the railway the soughing of the blowers of the blast-furnaces, the sharp crack of the exploding gases in the",
        "white-hot iron, the shriek of the locomotive whistle and all night long the roar and rattle of the passing trains, but so mellowed by the distance that the harsh sounds seem almost musical--almost as pleasant and as easily endured as the voices of nature.",
        "And in the early morning a look from the chamber window perhaps may show a locomotive whirling down the valley around the sharp curves with its white streamer flung out upon the green hillside, and seeming like a snowy ribbon cut from the huge mass of vapor which lies low upon the surface of the stream.",
        "The name of this town among the hills is--well, it has a very charming Indian name, to reveal which might be to point with",
        "too",
        "much distinctness to the worthy people who in some sort figure in the following pages.",
        "It shall be called Millburg in those pages, and its inhabitants shall tell their stories and play their parts under the cover of that unsuggestive title;",
        "so that the curious reader of little faith shall have difficulty if he resolves to discover the whereabouts of the village and to",
        "inquire respecting",

        "Mr. Fogg, devoted and faithful father that he is, used to take",
        "a good deal more than his share of the nursing of the infant, and often, when he would turn out of bed for the fifteenth or sixteenth time and with fluttering garments and unshod feet carry the baby to and fro, soothing it with a little song, he would think how true it is, as Napoleon once said, that \"the only real courage is two-o'clock-in-the-morning courage.",
        "\" Mr. Fogg thought he had a reasonable amount of genuine bravery, and justly, for he performed the functions of a nurse with unsurpassed patience and good humor.",
        "One night, however, the baby was unusually wakeful and tempestuous, and after struggling with it for several hours he called Mrs.",
        "Fogg and suggested that it would be well to give the child some paregoric to relieve",

        "He had no notion that he could exercise such power; but while musing upon the subject he rubbed the baby's eyebrows carelessly with his fingers and made several passes with his hands upon its forehead.",
        "As Mrs.",
        "Fogg began to feel her way up stairs, he was surprised and pleased to find that the baby had become quiet and had dropped off into sweet and peaceful slumber.",
        "Mrs.",

        "BRADLEY_.",
        "Mr. Bradley, our inventor, has had some experiences in addition to those already recorded which may perhaps be entertaining to the reader.",
        "One of the peculiarities of Bradley",
        "'s contrivances",
        "is that when they are designed to do a specified work, that is conspicuously",
        "the work they cannot possibly be induced to do.",
        "There, for instance, was Bradley's famous steam-pump.",
        "Some years ago Bradley invented a steam-pump for use on shipboard.",
        "He claimed for it that it",
        "would pump",
        "about three times as many gallons in a minute as any other pump, and he got some of his political friends in Congress to use their influence with the Navy Department to have it tried on one of the navy vessels.",
        "Finally he succeeded in having it introduced upon a small steamer, which we will call the Water Witch;",
        "and when everything was ready, the ship started upon a trial trip.",
        "Soon after she got to sea, Bradley, who was aboard, said he would like to try the pump upon",
        "the bilge-water",
        "to",
        "see how she worked.",
        "The captain ordered the engineer to turn it on, and the machine operated apparently in the most beautiful manner.",
        "In about an hour one of the officers reported that the water was gaining rapidly in the hold, and the captain sent some men down to discover where the leak was.",
        "They came back and reported that they couldn't find the hole, but that the water was pouring in somewhere in frightful quantities.",
        "Then some of the officers went down and spent half an hour in",
        "water up to their waists feeling around after",
        "that",
        "awful hole, but they couldn't ascertain where it was.",
        "The only thing that they",
        "were certain of was that the water was steadily gaining on them, and the ship was certain to sink unless something was done.",
        "All this time Mr. Bradley",
        "'s pump",
        "was working away, and the captain continually enjoined the engineer to give it greater speed.",
        "Then the captain himself went down and made an examination; and although he failed to find the leak, he was alarmed to discover a quantity of codfish and porpoises swimming about in the hold, because he knew that the hole in the hull must be very large indeed to admit the fish.",
        "And still the",
        "water rose steadily all",

        "time, although Bradley",

        "was jerking away at it in a terrific manner and all the other pumps were running at full speed.",
        "At last the captain made up his mind that he should have to desert the ship, as she was certain to sink; and so the boats were made ready and packed with provisions and water and a few little comforts, and by this time the water in the bilge was nearly up to the furnace fires.",

        "would give that steamer just four minutes",

        "On the following Monday the agricultural exhibition was to be held;",
        "but as Mr. Bradley foresaw that there would be a terrible north-east storm on that day, he suggested to the president of the society that it had better",

        "So they put it off; and that was the only clear Monday we had during May.",

        "was a slight spit of snow.",
        "So on the 15th, Bradley foresaw that the rest of the month would be wet; and by an odd coincidence a drought set in and it only rained once during the two weeks, and that was the day on which Bradley informed the base-ball club that it could play a match, because it would be clear.",
        "On toward the first of July he began to have some doubts if his improved weather-system was correct;",
        "he was convinced that it must work by contraries.",
        "So when",
        "Professor Jones asked him if it would be safe to attempt to have a display of fireworks on the night of the 5th, Bradley brought the improved system into play, and discovered that it promised rainy weather on that night.",
        "So then he was certain it would be clear; and he told Professor Jones to go ahead.",
        "On the night of the 5th, just as the professor got his Catherine-wheels and sky-rockets all in position, it began to rain;",

        "He leans on \"Old Probs\" now when he wants to ascertain the probable state of the weather.",
        "* * * * * When his first baby was born, Bradley invented a self-rocking cradle for it.",
        "He constructed the motive-power of the machine from some old clockwork which was operated by a huge steel ribbon spring strong enough to move a horse-car and long enough to run for a week without rewinding.",
        "When the cradle was completed, he put the baby in it upon a pillow and started the machinery.",
        "It worked beautifully, and after watching it for a while Bradley went to bed in a peaceful and happy frame of mind.",

        "Bang!",
        "Then a pin or something of the kind in the clockwork gave way, and before Bradley could get out of bed the cradle containing the baby was making ninety revolutions a minute, and hopping around the room and slamming up against the furniture in a manner that was simply awful to look at.",
        "[Illustration: BRADLEY'S CRADLE] How to get the child out was now the only consideration which presented itself to the mind of the inventor.",
        "A happy thought struck him.",
        "He took a slat out of the bedstead and held it under the cradle.",
        "On the",
        "next down-stroke it stopped",
        "with a jerk, and the baby was thrown, like a stone out of a catapult, against the washstand, fortunately",
        "with the pillow",
        "to",
        "break",
        "its fall.",
        "But the machine kept whizzing round and round the room as soon as the slat was withdrawn, and Bradley, in an ecstasy of rage, flung it out the back window into the yard.",
        "It continued to make such a clatter there that he had to go down and pile up barrels and slop-buckets and bricks and clothes-props and part of the grape-arbor on it, so that all it could do was to lie there all night buzzing with a kind of smothered",
        "hum and keeping the next-door neighbors awake, so that",
        "they pelted it with bootjacks, under the impression",
        "that",

        "Mrs.",
        "Bradley expressed such decided views respecting cradles of that pattern that Mr. Bradley turned his attention to other matters than those of a domestic character.",
        "He resolved",
        "to revolutionize navigation.",
        "It occurred to him that some kind of an",
        "apparatus might",
        "be devised by which a man could walk upon the surface of the water, and he went to work at it.",

        "These were to be fastened to the feet; and Bradley informed his friends that with a little practice a man could glide over the bosom of a river with the ease and velocity with which a good skater skims over the ice.",
        "It looked like a splendid thing.",
        "Bradley said that it would certainly produce a revolution in navigation, and make men wholly independent of steamers and other vessels when they desired to travel upon",

        "Bradley intimated that the day would come when a man would mount a water perambulator and go drifting off to India, sliding over the bounding billows of the dark blue sea as serenely as if he were walking along a turnpike.",
        "And one day Bradley asked a select",
        "party to come down to the river to see",
        "him make a trial-trip.",
        "At the appointed time he appeared with something that looked like a small frigate under each arm;",

        "and when he had dropped into the water, he steadied himself for a moment by holding to the pier while he fastened his eye upon his destination and prepared to start.",
