The professors of sociology, in exploring the mysteries of the science of human living, have not agreed that elbow-room is one of the great needs of modern civilized society, but this may be because they have not yet reached the bottom of things and discovered the truth. In crowded communities men have chances of development in certain directions, but in others their growth is surely checked. A man who lives in a large city is apt to experience a sharpening of his wits, for attrition of minds as well as of pebbles produces polish and brilliancy; but perhaps this very process prevents the free unfolding of parts of his character. If his individuality is not partially lost amid the crowd, it is likely that, first, his imitative faculty will induce him to shape himself in accordance with another than his own pattern, and that, second, the dread of the conspicuousness which is the certain result of eccentricity will persuade him to avoid any tendency he may have to become strongly unlike his neighbors. The house that he lives in is tightly squeezed in a row of dwellings builded upon a precisely similar plan, so that the influence brought to bear upon him by the home resembles to some extent that which operates upon his fellows. There is a pressure upon both sides of him in the house; and when he plunges into business, there is a far greater pressure there, in the shape of sharp competition, which brings him into constant collision with other men, and mayhap drives him or compels him to drive his weaker rival to the wall. The city-man is likely to cover himself with a mantle of reserve and dissimulation. If he has a longing to wander in untrodden and devious paths, he is disposed resolutely to suppress his desire and to go in the beaten track. If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith. And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example. In smaller and less densely-populated communities the weight of public opinion is not largely decreased, but the pressure is not so great. There is more elbow-room. A man who knows everybody about him gauges with a reasonable degree of accuracy the characters of those who are to judge him, and is able to form a pretty fair estimate of the value of their opinions. When men can do this, they are apt to feel a greater degree of freedom in following their natural impulses. If men could sound the depths of all knowledge and read with ease the secrets of the universe, they might lose much of their reverence. When they know the exact worth of the judgment of their fellow-men, they begin to regard it with comparative indifference.

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion. If it is filled with nonsense, that nonsense at any rate is innocent. It is modest, cleanly and without malice or irreverence. A worthier and nobler work might have been written; a purer work could not have been. What its other merits are he who reads it will discern. To apologize for it in any manner would be to admit that it has grave deficiencies, and such an admission the author would not make even if his conscience impelled him to do so. The book is offered to the reader with the conviction that if the man who laughs is the happiest man, it may contribute something to the sum of human felicity. The story of the French horn, related in the twentieth chapter, will recall to the reader of the \"Sparrowgrass Papers\" an incident related in that most charming book of humor. Perhaps it ought to be said that the former narrative was at least suggested by the latter. The artist who has illustrated the book, Mr. Arthur B. Frost, deserves to have it said of him that he has done his work skilfully, tastefully and with nice appreciation of the humor of the various situations. CONTENTS CHAPTER I.

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion. If it is filled with nonsense, that nonsense at any rate is innocent. It is modest, cleanly and without malice or irreverence. A worthier and nobler work might have been written; a purer work could not have been. What its other merits are he who reads it will discern. To apologize for it in any manner would be to admit that it has grave deficiencies, and such an admission the author would not make even if his conscience impelled him to do so. The book is offered to the reader with the conviction that if the man who laughs is the happiest man, it may contribute something to the sum of human felicity. The story of the French horn, related in the twentieth chapter, will recall to the reader of the \"Sparrowgrass Papers\" an incident related in that most charming book of humor. Perhaps it ought to be said that the former narrative was at least suggested by the latter. The artist who has illustrated the book, Mr. Arthur B. Frost, deserves to have it said of him that he has done his work skilfully, tastefully and with nice appreciation of the humor of the various situations. CONTENTS CHAPTER I.

BALLAST MAJOR SLOTT 'S TIGER FACING THE TIGER CHAPTER I. PROLOGUE. _THE ADVANTAGES OF ELBOW-ROOM_. The professors of sociology, in exploring the mysteries of the science of human living, have not agreed that elbow-room is one of the great needs of modern civilized society, but this may be because they have not yet reached the bottom of things and discovered the truth. In crowded communities men have chances of development in certain directions, but in others their growth is surely checked. A man who lives in a large city is apt to experience a sharpening of his wits, for attrition of minds as well as of pebbles produces polish and brilliancy; but perhaps this very process prevents the free unfolding of parts of his character. If his individuality is not partially lost amid the crowd, it is likely that, first, his imitative faculty will induce him to shape himself in accordance with another than his own pattern, and that, second, the dread of the conspicuousness which is the certain result of eccentricity will persuade him to avoid any tendency he may have to become strongly unlike his neighbors. The house that he lives in is tightly squeezed in a row of dwellings builded upon a precisely similar plan, so that the influence brought to bear upon him by the home resembles to some extent that which operates upon his fellows. There is a pressure upon both sides of him in the house; and when he plunges into business, there is a far greater pressure there, in the shape of sharp competition, which brings him into constant collision with other men, and mayhap drives him or compels him to drive his weaker rival to the wall. The city-man is likely to cover himself with a mantle of reserve and dissimulation. If he has a longing to wander in untrodden and devious paths, he is disposed resolutely to suppress his desire and to go in the beaten track. If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith. And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example. In smaller and less densely-populated communities the weight of public opinion is not largely decreased, but the pressure is not so great. There is more elbow-room. A man who knows everybody about him gauges with a reasonable degree of accuracy the characters of those who are to judge him, and is able to form a pretty fair estimate of the value of their opinions. When men can do this, they are apt to feel a greater degree of freedom in following their natural impulses. If men could sound the depths of all knowledge and read with ease the secrets of the universe, they might lose much of their reverence. When they know the exact worth of the judgment of their fellow-men, they begin to regard it with comparative indifference. And so, if a dweller in a small village desires to leave the beaten track, he can summon courage to do so with greater readiness than the man of the town . If he has occasionally that proneness to make a fool of himself which seizes every man now and then, he may indulge in the perilous luxury without great carefulness of the consequences . Smith 's ordinary conduct is the admiration of Jones as a regular thing; but when Smith switches off into some eccentricity for which Jones has no inclination, it is only a matter of course that Jones should indulge in his own little oddities without caring whether Smith smiles upon him or not.",

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion. If it is filled with nonsense, that nonsense at any rate is innocent. It is modest, cleanly and without malice or irreverence. A worthier and nobler work might have been written; a purer work could not have been. What its other merits are he who reads it will discern. To apologize for it in any manner would be to admit that it has grave deficiencies, and such an admission the author would not make even if his conscience impelled him to do so. The book is offered to the reader with the conviction that if the man who laughs is the happiest man, it may contribute something to the sum of human felicity. The story of the French horn, related in the twentieth chapter, will recall to the reader of the \"Sparrowgrass Papers\" an incident related in that most charming book of humor. Perhaps it ought to be said that the former narrative was at least suggested by the latter. The artist who has illustrated the book, Mr. Arthur B. Frost, deserves to have it said of him that he has done his work skilfully, tastefully and with nice appreciation of the humor of the various situations. CONTENTS CHAPTER I.

BALLAST MAJOR SLOTT 'S TIGER FACING THE TIGER CHAPTER I. PROLOGUE. _THE ADVANTAGES OF ELBOW-ROOM_. The professors of sociology, in exploring the mysteries of the science of human living, have not agreed that elbow-room is one of the great needs of modern civilized society, but this may be because they have not yet reached the bottom of things and discovered the truth. In crowded communities men have chances of development in certain directions, but in others their growth is surely checked. A man who lives in a large city is apt to experience a sharpening of his wits, for attrition of minds as well as of pebbles produces polish and brilliancy; but perhaps this very process prevents the free unfolding of parts of his character. If his individuality is not partially lost amid the crowd, it is likely that, first, his imitative faculty will induce him to shape himself in accordance with another than his own pattern, and that, second, the dread of the conspicuousness which is the certain result of eccentricity will persuade him to avoid any tendency he may have to become strongly unlike his neighbors. The house that he lives in is tightly squeezed in a row of dwellings builded upon a precisely similar plan, so that the influence brought to bear upon him by the home resembles to some extent that which operates upon his fellows. There is a pressure upon both sides of him in the house; and when he plunges into business, there is a far greater pressure there, in the shape of sharp competition, which brings him into constant collision with other men, and mayhap drives him or compels him to drive his weaker rival to the wall. The city-man is likely to cover himself with a mantle of reserve and dissimulation. If he has a longing to wander in untrodden and devious paths, he is disposed resolutely to suppress his desire and to go in the beaten track. If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith. And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example. In smaller and less densely-populated communities the weight of public opinion is not largely decreased, but the pressure is not so great. There is more elbow-room. A man who knows everybody about him gauges with a reasonable degree of accuracy the characters of those who are to judge him, and is able to form a pretty fair estimate of the value of their opinions. When men can do this, they are apt to feel a greater degree of freedom in following their natural impulses. If men could sound the depths of all knowledge and read with ease the secrets of the universe, they might lose much of their reverence. When they know the exact worth of the judgment of their fellow-men, they begin to regard it with comparative indifference. And so, if a dweller in a small village desires to leave the beaten track, he can summon courage to do so with greater readiness than the man of the town . If he has occasionally that proneness to make a fool of himself which seizes every man now and then, he may indulge in the perilous luxury without great carefulness of the consequences . Smith 's ordinary conduct is the admiration of Jones as a regular thing; but when Smith switches off into some eccentricity for which Jones has no inclination, it is only a matter of course that Jones should indulge in his own little oddities without caring whether Smith smiles upon him or not.",

BALLAST MAJOR SLOTT 'S TIGER FACING THE TIGER CHAPTER I. PROLOGUE. _THE ADVANTAGES OF ELBOW-ROOM_. The professors of sociology, in exploring the mysteries of the science of human living, have not agreed that elbow-room is one of the great needs of modern civilized society, but this may be because they have not yet reached the bottom of things and discovered the truth. In crowded communities men have chances of development in certain directions, but in others their growth is surely checked. A man who lives in a large city is apt to experience a sharpening of his wits, for attrition of minds as well as of pebbles produces polish and brilliancy; but perhaps this very process prevents the free unfolding of parts of his character. If his individuality is not partially lost amid the crowd, it is likely that, first, his imitative faculty will induce him to shape himself in accordance with another than his own pattern, and that, second, the dread of the conspicuousness which is the certain result of eccentricity will persuade him to avoid any tendency he may have to become strongly unlike his neighbors. The house that he lives in is tightly squeezed in a row of dwellings builded upon a precisely similar plan, so that the influence brought to bear upon him by the home resembles to some extent that which operates upon his fellows. There is a pressure upon both sides of him in the house; and when he plunges into business, there is a far greater pressure there, in the shape of sharp competition, which brings him into constant collision with other men, and mayhap drives him or compels him to drive his weaker rival to the wall. The city-man is likely to cover himself with a mantle of reserve and dissimulation. If he has a longing to wander in untrodden and devious paths, he is disposed resolutely to suppress his desire and to go in the beaten track. If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith. And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example. In smaller and less densely-populated communities the weight of public opinion is not largely decreased, but the pressure is not so great. There is more elbow-room. A man who knows everybody about him gauges with a reasonable degree of accuracy the characters of those who are to judge him, and is able to form a pretty fair estimate of the value of their opinions. When men can do this, they are apt to feel a greater degree of freedom in following their natural impulses. If men could sound the depths of all knowledge and read with ease the secrets of the universe, they might lose much of their reverence. When they know the exact worth of the judgment of their fellow-men, they begin to regard it with comparative indifference. And so, if a dweller in a small village desires to leave the beaten track, he can summon courage to do so with greater readiness than the man of the town . If he has occasionally that proneness to make a fool of himself which seizes every man now and then, he may indulge in the perilous luxury without great carefulness of the consequences . Smith 's ordinary conduct is the admiration of Jones as a regular thing; but when Smith switches off into some eccentricity for which Jones has no inclination, it is only a matter of course that Jones should indulge in his own little oddities without caring whether Smith smiles upon him or not.",

BALLAST MAJOR SLOTT 'S TIGER FACING THE TIGER CHAPTER I. PROLOGUE. _THE ADVANTAGES OF ELBOW-ROOM_. The professors of sociology, in exploring the mysteries of the science of human living, have not agreed that elbow-room is one of the great needs of modern civilized society, but this may be because they have not yet reached the bottom of things and discovered the truth. In crowded communities men have chances of development in certain directions, but in others their growth is surely checked. A man who lives in a large city is apt to experience a sharpening of his wits, for attrition of minds as well as of pebbles produces polish and brilliancy; but perhaps this very process prevents the free unfolding of parts of his character. If his individuality is not partially lost amid the crowd, it is likely that, first, his imitative faculty will induce him to shape himself in accordance with another than his own pattern, and that, second, the dread of the conspicuousness which is the certain result of eccentricity will persuade him to avoid any tendency he may have to become strongly unlike his neighbors. The house that he lives in is tightly squeezed in a row of dwellings builded upon a precisely similar plan, so that the influence brought to bear upon him by the home resembles to some extent that which operates upon his fellows. There is a pressure upon both sides of him in the house; and when he plunges into business, there is a far greater pressure there, in the shape of sharp competition, which brings him into constant collision with other men, and mayhap drives him or compels him to drive his weaker rival to the wall. The city-man is likely to cover himself with a mantle of reserve and dissimulation. If he has a longing to wander in untrodden and devious paths, he is disposed resolutely to suppress his desire and to go in the beaten track. If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith. And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example. In smaller and less densely-populated communities the weight of public opinion is not largely decreased, but the pressure is not so great. There is more elbow-room. A man who knows everybody about him gauges with a reasonable degree of accuracy the characters of those who are to judge him, and is able to form a pretty fair estimate of the value of their opinions. When men can do this, they are apt to feel a greater degree of freedom in following their natural impulses. If men could sound the depths of all knowledge and read with ease the secrets of the universe, they might lose much of their reverence. When they know the exact worth of the judgment of their fellow-men, they begin to regard it with comparative indifference. And so, if a dweller in a small village desires to leave the beaten track, he can summon courage to do so with greater readiness than the man of the town . If he has occasionally that proneness to make a fool of himself which seizes every man now and then, he may indulge in the perilous luxury without great carefulness of the consequences . Smith 's ordinary conduct is the admiration of Jones as a regular thing; but when Smith switches off into some eccentricity for which Jones has no inclination, it is only a matter of course that Jones should indulge in his own little oddities without caring whether Smith smiles upon him or not.",

CHAPTER II. _ THE TERRIBLE MISHAP TO MR. FOGG'S BABY _. Mr. and Mrs. Fogg have a young baby which was exceedingly restless and troublesome at night while it was cutting its teeth. Mr. Fogg, devoted and faithful father that he is, used to take a good deal more than his share of the nursing of the infant, and often, when he would turn out of bed for the fifteenth or sixteenth time and with fluttering garments and unshod feet carry the baby to and fro, soothing it with a little song, he would think how true it is, as Napoleon once said, that \"the only real courage is two-o'clock-in-the-morning courage. \" Mr. Fogg thought he had a reasonable amount of genuine bravery, and justly, for he performed the functions of a nurse with unsurpassed patience and good humor. One night, however, the baby was unusually wakeful and tempestuous, and after struggling with it for several hours he called Mrs. Fogg and suggested that it would be well to give the child some paregoric to relieve it from the intense pain from which it was evidently suffering. The medicine stood upon the bureau, but Mrs. Fogg had to go down stairs to the dining-room to get some sugar ; and while she was fumbling about in the entry in the dark it occurred to Mr. Fogg that he had heard of persons being relieved from pain by applications of mesmerism. He had no notion that he could exercise such power; but while musing upon the subject he rubbed the baby's eyebrows carelessly with his fingers and made several passes with his hands upon its forehead. As Mrs. Fogg began to feel her way up stairs, he was surprised and pleased to find that the baby had become quiet and had dropped off into sweet and peaceful slumber. Mrs. Fogg put the sugar away as her husband placed the child in its crib and covered it up carefully, and then they went to bed. [Illustration: MR. FOGG AS A MESMERIST] They were not disturbed again that night, and in the morning the baby was still fast asleep. Mrs. Fogg said she guessed the poor little darling must have gotten a tooth through, which made it feel easier. Mr. Fogg said, \"Maybe it has. \" But he had a faint though very dark suspicion that something was wrong. After breakfast he went up to the bed-room to see if the baby was awake. It still remained asleep; and Mr. Fogg, when he had leaned over and listened to its breathing, shook it roughly three or four times and cleared his throat in a somewhat boisterous manner. But it did not wake, and Mr. Fogg went down stairs with a horrible dread upon him, and assuming his hat prepared to go to the office. Mrs. Fogg called to him, \"Don't slam the front door and wake the baby! \" And then Mr. Fogg did slam it with extraordinary violence ; after which he walked up the street with gloom in his soul and a wretched feeling of apprehension that the baby would never waken. \"What on earth would we do if it should stay asleep for years? S'pose'n it should sleep right straight ahead for half a century, and grow to be an old man without knowing its pa and ma, and without ever learning anything or seeing anything! \" The thought maddened him. He remembered Rip Van Winkle; he recalled the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus; he thought of the afflicted woman whom he saw once at a menagerie in a trance, in which she had been for twenty years continuously, excepting when she awoke for a few moments at long intervals to ask for something to eat. Perhaps when he and Mrs. Fogg were dead the baby might be rented to a menagerie, and be carried around the country as a spectacle. The idea haunted him. It made him miserable. He tried for two or three hours to fix his mind upon his office-duties, but it was impossible. He determined to go back to the house to ascertain if the baby had returned to consciousness. When he got there, Mrs. Fogg was beginning to feel very uneasy. She said, \"Isn't it strange, Wilberforce, that the baby stays asleep? He is not awake yet. I suppose it is nervous exhaustion, poor darling! but I am a little worried about it. \" Mr. Fogg felt awfully. He went up and jagged a pin into the baby's leg quietly, so that his wife could not see him. Still it lay there wrapped in slumber; and after repeating the experiment he abandoned himself to despair and went back to his office, uncertain whether to fly or to go home and confess the terrible truth to Mrs. Fogg. In a couple of hours that lovely woman came in to see him. She was scared and breathless: \"Mr. Fogg, the baby is actually asleep yet, and I can't rouse him. I've shaken him, called to him and done _everything_, and he don't stir. What _can_ be the matter with him? I'm afraid something dreadful has happened to him. \" \"Maybe he is sleeping up a lot ahead, so's to stay awake at night some more, \" said Mr. Fogg, with a feeble smile at his attempt at a joke. \"Wilberforce, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to trifle with such a matter! S'pose the baby should die while it is in that condition? I believe it _is_ going to die, and I want you to go straight for the doctor. \" Mr. Fogg started at once, and in half an hour he reached the house in company with Dr. Gill. The doctor examined the child carefully and said that it was a very queer case, but that, in his opinion, he must be under the influence of opium. \" Did you give him any while I was asleep last night, Mr. Fogg? \" asked Mrs. Fogg, suspiciously and tearfully. \"Upon my word and honor I didn't,\" said Mr. Fogg, with the cold perspiration standing upon his forehead. \"Are you _sure_ you didn't give him _anything_? \" demanded the mother, suddenly remembering that the baby became quiet while she was down stairs upon the preceding night. \"Maria, do you think I would deceive you? \" asked Mr. Fogg, in agony. \"I'll take my solemn oath that I did not give it a drop of medicine of any kind. \" \" It is very remarkable--very,\" said the doctor. \"I don't know that I ever encountered precisely such a case before. I think I will call in Dr. Brown and consult with him about it. \" Then Mrs. Fogg began to sob; and while she fondled the baby, Mr. Fogg, feeling like a murderer, followed the doctor down stairs. When they reached the hall, Mr. Fogg drew the doctor aside and said, in a confidential whisper: \"Doctor, I am going to tell you something, but I want you to promise solemnly that you will keep it a secret. \" \"Very well; what is it? \" \" You won't tell Mrs. Fogg? \" \" No. \" \"Well, doctor, I--I--I--know what is the matter with that baby. \" \"You do! you know! Well, why didn't you--What _is_ the matter with it? \" \" The fact is, I mesmerized it last night. \" \" You did! Mesmerized it! And why don't you rouse it up again ? \" \"I don't know how; that's the mischief of it. I did it accidentally, you know. I was sort of fingering around the child 's forehead, and all of a sudden it stopped crying and dropped off. Can't you find me a professional mesmerizer to come and undo the baby? \" \" I don't believe I can. The only one I know of lives in San Francisco, and he couldn't get here in less than a week even if we should telegraph for him. \" \" By that time,\" shrieked Mr. Fogg, \"the baby'll be dead and Maria will be insane! What, under Heaven, are we going to do about it? \" \"Let 's hunt up Brown ; maybe he knows. \" So they went around to Dr. Brown 's office and revealed the secret to him. Brown seemed to think that he might perhaps do something to rob the situation of its horrors, and he accompanied Mr. Fogg and Dr. Gill to the house. When they entered, Mrs. Fogg was rapidly becoming hysterical. Dr. Brown placed the baby on the bed; he slapped its little hands and rubbed its forehead and dashed cold water in",

One night, however, the baby was unusually wakeful and tempestuous, and after struggling with it for several hours he called Mrs. Fogg and suggested that it would be well to give the child some paregoric to relieve it from the intense pain from which it was evidently suffering. The medicine stood upon the bureau, but Mrs. Fogg had to go down stairs to the dining-room to get some sugar ; and while she was fumbling about in the entry in the dark it occurred to Mr. Fogg that he had heard of persons being relieved from pain by applications of mesmerism. He had no notion that he could exercise such power; but while musing upon the subject he rubbed the baby's eyebrows carelessly with his fingers and made several passes with his hands upon its forehead. As Mrs. Fogg began to feel her way up stairs, he was surprised and pleased to find that the baby had become quiet and had dropped off into sweet and peaceful slumber. Mrs. Fogg put the sugar away as her husband placed the child in its crib and covered it up carefully, and then they went to bed. [Illustration: MR. FOGG AS A MESMERIST] They were not disturbed again that night, and in the morning the baby was still fast asleep. Mrs. Fogg said she guessed the poor little darling must have gotten a tooth through, which made it feel easier. Mr. Fogg said, \"Maybe it has. \" But he had a faint though very dark suspicion that something was wrong. After breakfast he went up to the bed-room to see if the baby was awake. It still remained asleep; and Mr. Fogg, when he had leaned over and listened to its breathing, shook it roughly three or four times and cleared his throat in a somewhat boisterous manner. But it did not wake, and Mr. Fogg went down stairs with a horrible dread upon him, and assuming his hat prepared to go to the office. Mrs. Fogg called to him, \"Don't slam the front door and wake the baby! \" And then Mr. Fogg did slam it with extraordinary violence ; after which he walked up the street with gloom in his soul and a wretched feeling of apprehension that the baby would never waken. \"What on earth would we do if it should stay asleep for years? S'pose'n it should sleep right straight ahead for half a century, and grow to be an old man without knowing its pa and ma, and without ever learning anything or seeing anything! \" The thought maddened him. He remembered Rip Van Winkle; he recalled the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus; he thought of the afflicted woman whom he saw once at a menagerie in a trance, in which she had been for twenty years continuously, excepting when she awoke for a few moments at long intervals to ask for something to eat. Perhaps when he and Mrs. Fogg were dead the baby might be rented to a menagerie, and be carried around the country as a spectacle. The idea haunted him. It made him miserable. He tried for two or three hours to fix his mind upon his office-duties, but it was impossible. He determined to go back to the house to ascertain if the baby had returned to consciousness. When he got there, Mrs. Fogg was beginning to feel very uneasy. She said, \"Isn't it strange, Wilberforce, that the baby stays asleep? He is not awake yet. I suppose it is nervous exhaustion, poor darling! but I am a little worried about it. \" Mr. Fogg felt awfully. He went up and jagged a pin into the baby's leg quietly, so that his wife could not see him. Still it lay there wrapped in slumber; and after repeating the experiment he abandoned himself to despair and went back to his office, uncertain whether to fly or to go home and confess the terrible truth to Mrs. Fogg. In a couple of hours that lovely woman came in to see him. She was scared and breathless: \"Mr. Fogg, the baby is actually asleep yet, and I can't rouse him. I've shaken him, called to him and done _everything_, and he don't stir. What _can_ be the matter with him? I'm afraid something dreadful has happened to him. \" \"Maybe he is sleeping up a lot ahead, so's to stay awake at night some more, \" said Mr. Fogg, with a feeble smile at his attempt at a joke. \"Wilberforce, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to trifle with such a matter! S'pose the baby should die while it is in that condition? I believe it _is_ going to die, and I want you to go straight for the doctor. \" Mr. Fogg started at once, and in half an hour he reached the house in company with Dr. Gill.",

S'pose the baby should die while it is in that condition? I believe it _is_ going to die, and I want you to go straight for the doctor. \" Mr. Fogg started at once, and in half an hour he reached the house in company with Dr. Gill. The doctor examined the child carefully and said that it was a very queer case, but that, in his opinion, he must be under the influence of opium. \" Did you give him any while I was asleep last night, Mr. Fogg? \" asked Mrs. Fogg, suspiciously and tearfully. \"Upon my word and honor I didn't,\" said Mr. Fogg, with the cold perspiration standing upon his forehead. \"Are you _sure_ you didn't give him _anything_? \" demanded the mother, suddenly remembering that the baby became quiet while she was down stairs upon the preceding night. \"Maria, do you think I would deceive you? \" asked Mr. Fogg, in agony. \"I'll take my solemn oath that I did not give it a drop of medicine of any kind. \" \" It is very remarkable--very,\" said the doctor. \"I don't know that I ever encountered precisely such a case before. I think I will call in Dr. Brown and consult with him about it. \" Then Mrs. Fogg began to sob; and while she fondled the baby, Mr. Fogg, feeling like a murderer, followed the doctor down stairs. When they reached the hall, Mr. Fogg drew the doctor aside and said, in a confidential whisper: \"Doctor, I am going to tell you something, but I want you to promise solemnly that you will keep it a secret. \" \"Very well; what is it? \" \" You won't tell Mrs. Fogg? \" \" No. \" \"Well, doctor, I--I--I--know what is the matter with that baby.",

I believe it _is_ going to die, and I want you to go straight for the doctor. \" Mr. Fogg started at once, and in half an hour he reached the house in company with Dr. Gill. The doctor examined the child carefully and said that it was a very queer case, but that, in his opinion, he must be under the influence of opium. \" Did you give him any while I was asleep last night, Mr. Fogg? \" asked Mrs. Fogg, suspiciously and tearfully. \"Upon my word and honor I didn't,\" said Mr. Fogg, with the cold perspiration standing upon his forehead. \"Are you _sure_ you didn't give him _anything_? \" demanded the mother, suddenly remembering that the baby became quiet while she was down stairs upon the preceding night. \"Maria, do you think I would deceive you? \" asked Mr. Fogg, in agony. \"I'll take my solemn oath that I did not give it a drop of medicine of any kind. \" \" It is very remarkable--very,\" said the doctor. \"I don't know that I ever encountered precisely such a case before. I think I will call in Dr. Brown and consult with him about it. \" Then Mrs. Fogg began to sob; and while she fondled the baby, Mr. Fogg, feeling like a murderer, followed the doctor down stairs. When they reached the hall, Mr. Fogg drew the doctor aside and said, in a confidential whisper: \"Doctor, I am going to tell you something, but I want you to promise solemnly that you will keep it a secret. \" \"Very well; what is it? \" \" You won't tell Mrs. Fogg? \" \" No. \" \"Well, doctor, I--I--I--know what is the matter with that baby. \" \"You do! you know! Well, why didn't you--What _is_ the matter with it? \" \" The fact is, I mesmerized it last night. \" \" You did! Mesmerized it!",

        "excerpt": "Mrs. Fogg have a young baby which was exceedingly restless and troublesome at night while it was cutting its teeth. Mr. Fogg, devoted and faithful father that he is, used to take a good deal more than his share of the nursing of the infant, and often, when he would turn out of bed for the fifteenth or sixteenth time and with fluttering garments and unshod feet carry the baby to and fro, soothing it with a little song, he would think how true it is, as Napoleon once said, that \"the only real courage is two-o'clock-in-the-morning courage. \" Mr. Fogg thought he had a reasonable amount of genuine bravery, and justly, for he performed the functions of a nurse with unsurpassed patience and good humor. One night, however, the baby was unusually wakeful and tempestuous, and after struggling with it for several hours he called Mrs. Fogg and suggested that it would be well to give the child some paregoric to relieve it from the intense pain from which it was evidently suffering. The medicine stood upon the bureau, but Mrs. Fogg had to go down stairs to the dining-room to get some sugar ; and while she was fumbling about in the entry in the dark it occurred to Mr. Fogg that he had heard of persons being relieved from pain by applications of mesmerism. He had no notion that he could exercise such power; but while musing upon the subject he rubbed the baby's eyebrows carelessly with his fingers and made several passes with his hands upon its forehead. As Mrs. Fogg began to feel her way up stairs, he was surprised and pleased to find that the baby had become quiet and had dropped off into sweet and peaceful slumber. Mrs. Fogg put the sugar away as her husband placed the child in its crib and covered it up carefully, and then they went to bed. [Illustration: MR. FOGG AS A MESMERIST] They were not disturbed again that night, and in the morning the baby was still fast asleep. Mrs. Fogg said she guessed the poor little darling must have gotten a tooth through, which made it feel easier. Mr. Fogg said, \"Maybe it has. \" But he had a faint though very dark suspicion that something was wrong. After breakfast he went up to the bed-room to see if the baby was awake. It still remained asleep; and Mr. Fogg, when he had leaned over and listened to its breathing, shook it roughly three or four times and cleared his throat in a somewhat boisterous manner. But it did not wake, and Mr. Fogg went down stairs with a horrible dread upon him, and assuming his hat prepared to go to the office. Mrs. Fogg called to him, \"Don't slam the front door and wake the baby! \" And then Mr. Fogg did slam it with extraordinary violence ; after which he walked up the street with gloom in his soul and a wretched feeling of apprehension that the baby would never waken. \"What on earth would we do if it should stay asleep for years? S'pose'n it should sleep right straight ahead for half a century, and grow to be an old man without knowing its pa and ma, and without ever learning anything or seeing anything! \" The thought maddened him. He remembered Rip Van Winkle; he recalled the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus; he thought of the afflicted woman whom he saw once at a menagerie in a trance, in which she had been for twenty years continuously, excepting when she awoke for a few moments at long intervals to ask for something to eat. Perhaps when he and Mrs. Fogg were dead the baby might be rented to a menagerie, and be carried around the country as a spectacle. The idea haunted him. It made him miserable. He tried for two or three hours to fix his mind upon his office-duties, but it was impossible. He determined to go back to the house to ascertain if the baby had returned to consciousness. When he got there, Mrs. Fogg was beginning to feel very uneasy. She said, \"Isn't it strange, Wilberforce, that the baby stays asleep? He is not awake yet. I suppose it is nervous exhaustion, poor darling! but I am a little worried about it. \" Mr. Fogg felt awfully. He went up and jagged a pin into the baby's leg quietly, so that his wife could not see him. Still it lay there wrapped in slumber; and after repeating the experiment he abandoned himself to despair and went back to his office, uncertain whether to fly or to go home and confess the terrible truth to Mrs. Fogg. In a couple of hours that lovely woman came in to see him. She was scared and breathless: \"Mr. Fogg, the baby is actually asleep yet, and I can't rouse him. I've shaken him, called to him and done _everything_, and he don't stir. What _can_ be the matter with him? I'm afraid something dreadful has happened to him. \" \"Maybe he is sleeping up a lot ahead, so's to stay awake at night some more, \" said Mr. Fogg, with a feeble smile at his attempt at a joke. \"Wilberforce, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to trifle with such a matter! S'pose the baby should die while it is in that condition? I believe it _is_ going to die, and I want you to go straight for the doctor. \" Mr. Fogg started at once, and in half an hour he reached the house in company with Dr. Gill. The doctor examined the child carefully and said that it was a very queer case, but that, in his opinion, he must be under the influence of opium. \" Did you give him any while I was asleep last night, Mr. Fogg? \" asked Mrs. Fogg, suspiciously and tearfully. \"Upon my word and honor I didn't,\" said Mr. Fogg, with the cold perspiration standing upon his forehead. \"Are you _sure_ you didn't give him _anything_? \" demanded the mother, suddenly remembering that the baby became quiet while she was down stairs upon the preceding night. \"Maria, do you think I would deceive you? \" asked Mr. Fogg, in agony. \"I'll take my solemn oath that I did not give it a drop of medicine of any kind. \" \" It is very remarkable--very,\" said the doctor. \"I don't know that I ever encountered precisely such a case before. I think I will call in Dr. Brown and consult with him about it. \" Then Mrs. Fogg began to sob; and while she fondled the baby, Mr. Fogg, feeling like a murderer, followed the doctor down stairs. When they reached the hall, Mr. Fogg drew the doctor aside and said, in a confidential whisper: \"Doctor, I am going to tell you something, but I want you to promise solemnly that you will keep it a secret. \" \"Very well; what is it? \" \" You won't tell Mrs. Fogg? \" \" No. \" \"Well, doctor, I--I--I--know what is the matter with that baby. \" \"You do! you know! Well, why didn't you--What _is_ the matter with it? \" \" The fact is, I mesmerized it last night. \" \" You did! Mesmerized it! And why don't you rouse it up again ? \" \"I don't know how; that's the mischief of it. I did it accidentally, you know. I was sort of fingering around the child 's forehead, and all of a sudden it stopped crying and dropped off. Can't you find me a professional mesmerizer to come and undo the baby? \" \" I don't believe I can. The only one I know of lives in San Francisco, and he couldn't get here in less than a week even if we should telegraph for him. \" \" By that time,\" shrieked Mr. Fogg, \"the baby'll be dead and Maria will be insane! What, under Heaven, are we going to do about it? \" \"Let 's hunt up Brown ; maybe he knows. \" So they went around to Dr. Brown 's office and revealed the secret to him. Brown seemed to think that he might perhaps do something to rob the situation of its horrors, and he accompanied Mr. Fogg and Dr. Gill to the house. When they entered, Mrs. Fogg was rapidly becoming hysterical. Dr. Brown placed the baby on the bed; he slapped its little hands and rubbed its forehead and dashed cold water in its face. In a few moments the baby opened its eyes, then it suddenly sat up and began to cry. Mr. Fogg used to hate that noise, but now it seemed to him sweeter than music. Mrs. Fogg was wild with joy. She took the baby in her arms and kissed and hugged it, and then she said, \"What do you think was the matter with him, doctor?",

S'pose the baby should die while it is in that condition? I believe it _is_ going to die, and I want you to go straight for the doctor. \" Mr. Fogg started at once, and in half an hour he reached the house in company with Dr. Gill. The doctor examined the child carefully and said that it was a very queer case, but that, in his opinion, he must be under the influence of opium. \" Did you give him any while I was asleep last night, Mr. Fogg? \" asked Mrs. Fogg, suspiciously and tearfully. \"Upon my word and honor I didn't,\" said Mr. Fogg, with the cold perspiration standing upon his forehead. \"Are you _sure_ you didn't give him _anything_? \" demanded the mother, suddenly remembering that the baby became quiet while she was down stairs upon the preceding night. \"Maria, do you think I would deceive you? \" asked Mr. Fogg, in agony. \"I'll take my solemn oath that I did not give it a drop of medicine of any kind. \" \" It is very remarkable--very,\" said the doctor. \"I don't know that I ever encountered precisely such a case before. I think I will call in Dr. Brown and consult with him about it. \" Then Mrs. Fogg began to sob; and while she fondled the baby, Mr. Fogg, feeling like a murderer, followed the doctor down stairs. When they reached the hall, Mr. Fogg drew the doctor aside and said, in a confidential whisper: \"Doctor, I am going to tell you something, but I want you to promise solemnly that you will keep it a secret. \" \"Very well; what is it? \" \" You won't tell Mrs. Fogg? \" \" No. \" \"Well, doctor, I--I--I--know what is the matter with that baby. \" \"You do! you know! Well, why didn't you--What _is_ the matter with it? \" \" The fact is, I mesmerized it last night. \" \" You did! Mesmerized it! And why don't you rouse it up again ? \" \"I don't know how; that's the mischief of it. I did it accidentally, you know. I was sort of fingering around the child 's forehead, and all of a sudden it stopped crying and dropped off. Can't you find me a professional mesmerizer to come and undo the baby? \" \" I don't believe I can. The only one I know of lives in San Francisco, and he couldn't get here in less than a week even if we should telegraph for him. \" \" By that time,\" shrieked Mr. Fogg, \"the baby'll be dead and Maria will be insane! What, under Heaven, are we going to do about it? \" \"Let 's hunt up Brown ; maybe he knows. \" So they went around to Dr. Brown 's office and revealed the secret to him. Brown seemed to think that he might perhaps do something to rob the situation of its horrors, and he accompanied Mr. Fogg and Dr. Gill to the house. When they entered, Mrs. Fogg was rapidly becoming hysterical. Dr. Brown placed the baby on the bed; he slapped its little hands and rubbed its forehead and dashed cold water in its face. In a few moments the baby opened its eyes, then it suddenly sat up and began to cry. Mr. Fogg used to hate that noise, but now it seemed to him sweeter than music. Mrs. Fogg was wild with joy. She took the baby in her arms and kissed and hugged it, and then she said, \"What do you think was the matter with him, doctor? \" \" Why, your husband says he mesmerized the child,\" replied the doctor, incautiously letting the secret drop.",

S'pose the baby should die while it is in that condition? I believe it _is_ going to die, and I want you to go straight for the doctor. \" Mr. Fogg started at once, and in half an hour he reached the house in company with Dr. Gill. The doctor examined the child carefully and said that it was a very queer case, but that, in his opinion, he must be under the influence of opium. \" Did you give him any while I was asleep last night, Mr. Fogg? \" asked Mrs. Fogg, suspiciously and tearfully. \"Upon my word and honor I didn't,\" said Mr. Fogg, with the cold perspiration standing upon his forehead. \"Are you _sure_ you didn't give him _anything_? \" demanded the mother, suddenly remembering that the baby became quiet while she was down stairs upon the preceding night. \"Maria, do you think I would deceive you? \" asked Mr. Fogg, in agony. \"I'll take my solemn oath that I did not give it a drop of medicine of any kind. \" \" It is very remarkable--very,\" said the doctor. \"I don't know that I ever encountered precisely such a case before. I think I will call in Dr. Brown and consult with him about it. \" Then Mrs. Fogg began to sob; and while she fondled the baby, Mr. Fogg, feeling like a murderer, followed the doctor down stairs. When they reached the hall, Mr. Fogg drew the doctor aside and said, in a confidential whisper: \"Doctor, I am going to tell you something, but I want you to promise solemnly that you will keep it a secret. \" \"Very well; what is it? \" \" You won't tell Mrs. Fogg? \" \" No. \" \"Well, doctor, I--I--I--know what is the matter with that baby. \" \"You do! you know! Well, why didn't you--What _is_ the matter with it? \" \" The fact is, I mesmerized it last night. \" \" You did! Mesmerized it! And why don't you rouse it up again ? \" \"I don't know how; that's the mischief of it. I did it accidentally, you know. I was sort of fingering around the child 's forehead, and all of a sudden it stopped crying and dropped off. Can't you find me a professional mesmerizer to come and undo the baby? \" \" I don't believe I can. The only one I know of lives in San Francisco, and he couldn't get here in less than a week even if we should telegraph for him. \" \" By that time,\" shrieked Mr. Fogg, \"the baby'll be dead and Maria will be insane! What, under Heaven, are we going to do about it? \" \"Let 's hunt up Brown ; maybe he knows. \" So they went around to Dr. Brown 's office and revealed the secret to him. Brown seemed to think that he might perhaps do something to rob the situation of its horrors, and he accompanied Mr. Fogg and Dr. Gill to the house. When they entered, Mrs. Fogg was rapidly becoming hysterical. Dr. Brown placed the baby on the bed; he slapped its little hands and rubbed its forehead and dashed cold water in its face. In a few moments the baby opened its eyes, then it suddenly sat up and began to cry. Mr. Fogg used to hate that noise, but now it seemed to him sweeter than music. Mrs. Fogg was wild with joy. She took the baby in her arms and kissed and hugged it, and then she said, \"What do you think was the matter with him, doctor? \" \" Why, your husband says he mesmerized the child,\" replied the doctor, incautiously letting the secret drop. Then Mrs. Fogg looked at the culprit as if she wished to assassinate him; but she merely ejaculated, \"Monster!\" and flew from the room; and Mr. Fogg, as he went down with the physicians, put on an injured look and said, \"If that baby wants to holloa now, I'm going to let him holloa, if he holloas the top of his head off. \" * * * * * It was this offence, according to popular rumor, that brought things to a crisis in Mr. Fogg's family and induced Mrs. Fogg to seek to remove the heavy burden of woe imposed upon her by her husband . Only a few days later Mr. and Mrs. Fogg knocked at the door of Colonel Coffin's law office, and then filed in, Mrs. Fogg in advance. Mr. Fogg, the reader may care to know, was a subdued, weak-eyed and timid person. He had the air of a victim of perpetual tyranny--of a man who had been ruthlessly and remorselessly sat upon until his spirit was wholly gone. And Mrs. Fogg looked as if she might have been his despot. She opened the conversation by addressing the lawyer: \"Colonel, I have called to engage you as my counsel in a divorce suit against Mr. Fogg. I have resolved to separate from him--to sunder our ties and henceforth to live apart. \" \"Indeed! \" replied the colonel; \"I'm sorry to hear that. What's the matter? Has he been beating and ill-treating you? \" \" Beating! \" exclaimed Mrs.",

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion.",

' Well, sir, about twenty pages farther on, where the villain insults her, you observe that her black eyes flashed lightning at him and seemed to scorch him where he stood. Now, let me direct attention to the fact that if the girl's eyes were blue they couldn't be black; and if you mean to convey the impression that she had one blue eye and one black eye, and that she only looked softly at Adolph out of the off eye, while the near eye roamed around, not doing anything in particular, why, she is too phenomenal for a novel, and only suitable for a place in the menagerie by the side of the curiosities. And then you say that although her eye was liquid yet it scorched the villain. People won't put up with that kind of thing. It makes them delirious and murderous. \" \"Too bad! \" said Stack. \"I forgot what I'd said about her eyes when I wrote that scene with the villain. \" \" And here, in the twentieth chapter, you say that Magruder was stabbed with a bowie-knife in the hands of the Spaniard, and in the next chapter you give an account of the _post-mortem _ examination, and make the doctors hunt for the bullet and find it embedded in his liver. Even patient readers can't remain calm under such circumstances. They lose control of themselves. \" \" It 's unfortunate,\" said Stack. \"Now, the way you manage the Browns in the story is also exasperating. First you represent Mrs. Brown as taking her twins around to church to be christened. In the middle of the book you make Mrs. Brown lament that she never had any children, and you wind up the story by bringing in Mrs. Brown with her grandson in her arms just after having caused Mr. Brown to state to the clergyman that the only child he ever had died in his fourth year. Just think of the effect of such a thing on the public mind! Why, this story would fill all the insane asylums in the country. \" \" Those Browns don't seem to be very definite, somehow,\" said Stack, thoughtfully. \"Worst of all,\" said major, \"in chapter thirty-one you make the lovers resolve upon suicide, and you put them in a boat and drift them over Niagara Falls. Twelve chapters farther on you suddenly introduce them walking in the twilight in a leafy lane, and although afterward she goes into a nunnery and takes the black veil because he has been killed by pirates in the Spanish West Indies, in the next chapter to the last you have a scene where she goes to a surprise-party at the Presbyterian minister's and finds him there making arrangements for the wedding as if nothing had ever happened; and then, after you disclose the fact that she was a boy in disguise, and not a woman at all, you marry them to each other, and represent the boy heroine as giving her blessing to her daughter. Oh, it's awful--awful! It won't do. It really won't. You'd better go into some other kind of business, Mr. Stack. \" Then Stack took his manuscript and went home to fix it up so as to make the story run together better. The _Patriot_ will not publish it even if Stack reconstructs it. * * * * * Major Slott, like most other editors, is continually persecuted by bores, but recently he was the victim of a peculiarly dastardly attack from a person of this class. While he was sitting in the office of the _Patriot_, writing an editorial about \"Our Grinding Monopolies,\" he suddenly became conscious of the presence of a fearful smell. He stopped, snuffed the air two or three times, and at last lighted a cigar to fumigate the room. Then he heard footsteps upon the stairs, and as they drew nearer the smell grew stronger. When it had reached a degree of intensity that caused the major to fear that it might break some of the furniture, there was a knock at the door. Then a man entered with a bundle under his arm, and as he did so the major thought that he had never smelt such a fiendish smell in the whole course of his life. He held his nose; and when the man saw the gesture, he said, \"I thought so; the usual effect. You hold it tight while I explain. \" \" What hab you god id that buddle? \" asked the major. \"That, sir,\" said the man, \"is Barker's Carbolic Disinfecting Door-mat. I am Barker, and this is the mat. I invented it, and it's a big thing. \" \" Is id thad thad smells so thudderig bad? \" asked the major, with his nostrils tightly shut. \"Yes, sir; smells very strong, but it's a healthy smell. It's invigorating. It braces the system. I'll tell you--\" \"Gid oud with the blabed thig! \" exclaimed the major. \"I must tell you all about it first. I called to explain it to you. You see I've been investigating the causes of epidemic diseases. Some scientists think they are spread by molecules in the air; others attribute them to gases generated in the sewers; others hold that they are conveyed by contagion; but I--\" \"Aid you goig to tague thad idferdal thig away frob here? \" asked the major. \"But I have discovered that these diseases are spread by the agency of door-mats. Do you understand? Door-mats! And I'll explain to you how it's done. Here's a man who's been in a house where there's disease. He gets it on his boots. The leather is porous, and it becomes saturated. He goes to another house and wipes his boots on the mat. Now, every man who uses that mat must get some of the stuff on his boots, and he spreads it over every other door-mat that he wipes them on. Now, don't he? \" \" Why dode you tague thad sbell frob udder by dose? \" \"Well, then, my idea is to construct a door-mat that will disinfect those boots. I do it by saturating the mat with carbolic acid and drying it gradually. I have one here prepared by my process. Shall I unroll it? \" \" If you do, I'll blow your braids out! \" shouted the major. \" Oh, very well, then.",

The congregation was wild with curiosity to know what was the matter. Then the deacon, blushing scarlet and seeming annoyed, walked down the aisle and whispered in Butterwick 's ear. Butterwick nodded, and whispered to his wife, who was perishing to know what it was. She leaned over and communicated it to Mrs. Bunnel, in the pew in front; and when the Bunnels all had it, they sent it on to the people next to them, and so before the doctor reached \"thirdly\" the whole congregation knew that he wanted to borrow Butterwick 's lawn-mower on Monday morning early. A day or two later, while Butterwick was crossing the creek upon a train of cars, the train ran off the track and rolled his car into the water. Butterwick got out, however, into the stream, and as he emerged, spluttering and blowing, he struck against a stranger who was treading water. The stranger apologized, and said that Butterwick might not recognize him in his dilapidated condition as Martin Thompson, but while they were together, he would like to put in a word for that lawn-mower when the parson was done with it. [Illustration: TREADING WATER] At last Butterwick grew tired of lending, and refused all applicants. Then the people began to steal it, and six respectable citizens only escaped going to jail because Butterwick had consideration for their families. Finally he chained it to the pump, and then they sawed off the pump and operated the mower with the log as a roller. Butterwick at last put it on top of his house, and that night fourteen ladders were seen against the wall. They did say that Ramsey, the lawyer, made one effort with a hot-air balloon, and failed only because he fell out and hurt his leg; but this was never traced to any reliable source. The following week a man arrived and opened an agency for the sale of the mowers in the village, and gradually the excitement abated. Butterwick, however, has cut his grass with a sickle ever since. CHAPTER VIII. _ THE MEETING AND ITS MISSIONARY WORK _. The Methodist church in the village is doing now, as it has always done, a good and noble work for Christianity and the cause of public morals ; but it has not escaped the trials which are permitted sometimes to afflict the Church militant. Years ago, when the congregation was first organized, it erected a small but very pretty frame meeting-house. In the course of time the people became dissatisfied with the location of the house of worship; and as they had a good offer for the site, they sold it and bought a better one in another quarter. Then they put rollers under the building, and as soon as it was off the ground the purchaser of the lot began to build a dwelling-house on the site. It was slow work pushing the church along the street, and before they got far somebody discovered that the title of the new site was not good, and so the bargain was annulled. The next day the brethren went plunging around town trying to buy another site, but nobody had one to sell; and on the following morning the supervisors got an order from the court requiring that meeting-house to be removed from the public street within twenty-four hours. The brethren were nearly wild about it, and they begged old Brindley to let them run the concern in on his vacant lot temporarily until they could look around. But Brindley belonged to another denomination, and he said he felt that it would be wrong for him to do anything to help a church that believed false doctrines. Then they ran the meeting-house out on the turnpike beyond the town, whereupon the turnpike company notified them that its charges would be eight dollars a day for toll. So they hauled it back again; and while going down the hill it broke loose, plunged through the fence of Dr. Mackey's garden and brought up on top of his asparagus-bed. He is an Episcopalian, and he sued the meeting for damages; and the sheriff levied upon the meetinghouse. The brethren paid the bill and dragged the building out again. They wanted to put it in the court-house yard, but Judge Twiddler, who is a Presbyterian, said that after examining the statutes carefully he could find no law allowing a Methodist meeting-house to be located in that place. In despair, the brethren ran the building down to the river-shore and fitted it on a huge raft of logs, concluding to tie it to the wharf until they could buy a lot. But as the owner of the wharf handed them on the third day a bill of twenty-five dollars for wharfage, they took the building out and anchored it in the stream. That night a tug-boat, coming up the river in the dark, ran halfway through the Sunday-school room, and a Dutch brig, coming into collision with it, was drawn out with the pulpit and three of the front pews dangling from the bowsprit. The owners of both vessels sued for damages, and the United States authorities talked of confiscating the meeting-house as an obstruction to navigation. But a few days afterward the ice-gorge sent a flood down the river and broke the building loose from its anchor. It was subsequently washed ashore on Keyser's farm; and he said he was willing to let it stay there at four dollars a day rent until he was ready to plough for corn. As the cost of removing it would have been very great, the trustees ultimately sold it to Keyser for a barn, and then, securing a good lot, they built a handsome edifice of stone. On the first Sunday that the congregation worshiped in the new church",

No, sir; when I put water in the milk, I do it out of kindness for the people who drink it. I do it because I'm philanthropic--because I'm sensitive and can't bear to see folks suffer. Now, s'pos'n a cow is bilious or something, and it makes her milk unwholesome. I give it a dash or two of water, and up it comes to the usual level. Water's the only thing that'll do it. Or s'pos'n that cow eats a pison vine in the woods; am I going to let my innocent customers be killed by it for the sake of saving a little labor at the pump? No, sir; I slush in a few quarts of water, neutralize the pison, and there she is as right as a trivet. \"But you take the best milk that ever was, and it ain't fit for the human stomach as it comes from the cow. It has too much caseine in it. Prof. Huxley says that millions of poor ignorant men and women are murdered every year by loading down weak stomachs with caseine. It sucks up the gastric juice, he says, and gets daubed all around over the membranes until the pores are choked, and then the first thing you know the man suddenly curls all up and dies. He says that out yer in Asia, where the milkmen are not as conscientious as we are, there are whole cemeteries chock full of people that have died of caseine, and that before long all that country will be one vast burying-ground if they don't ameliorate the milk. When I think of the responsibility resting on me, is it singular that I look at this old pump and wonder that people don't come and silver plate it and put my statue on it? I tell you, sir, that that humble pump with the cast-iron handle is the only thing that stands betwixt you and sudden death. \" And besides that, you know how kinder flat raw milk tastes--kinder insipid and mean. Now, Prof. Huxley, he says that there is only one thing that will vivify milk and make it luxurious to the palate, and that is water. Give it a few jerks under the pump, and out it comes sparkling and delicious, like nectar. I dunno how it is, but Prof. Huxley says that it undergoes some kinder chemical change that nothing else'll bring about but a flavoring of fine old pump-water.

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion.",

But no matter; I s'pose I can go round and borrow elsewhere. Good-morning; drop in some time, and I'll show you that casket. \" As Toombs was going out he met Mr. Banger at the door. When he was gone, Banger said, \"My dear, who is that very odd-looking man? \" And Mrs. Banger hesitated a moment, turned very red, and answered, \"That is--that man is--a--a--he is, I believe--a--a--a--a some kind of a--an undertaker. \" Then Banger looked gloomy and went up stairs to ponder. But Mrs. Banger felt that she had a duty to perform in taking care that the lot in the cemetery should not fall into such disorder as Mr. Toombs had indicated, and she resolved to call upon Mr. Mix, at his monumental marble-works, to get him to attend to the matter for her. Mr. Mix did not know her, and his ignorance of her past history turned out to be unfortunate. The following conversation occurred between them: _Mrs. Banger_. \"Mr. Mix, I am anxious to have my cemetery lot fixed up--to put in new tombstones and reset the railing ; and I called to see if I could make some satisfactory arrangement with you. \" _Mix_. \"Certainly, madam. Tell me precisely what it is you want done. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Well, I'd like to have a new tombstone put over the grave of John--my husband, you know--and to have a nice inscription cut in it, 'Here lies John Smyth,' etc., etc. You know what I mean; the usual way, of course, and maybe some kind of a design on the stone like a broken rosebud or something . \" _Mix_. \"I understand. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Well, then, what'll you charge me for getting up a headstone just like that, out of pretty good white marble, and with a little picture of a torch upside down or a weeping angel on it, and the name of Thomas Smith cut on it? \" _Mix_. \" John Smyth, you mean. \" _ Mrs. B _. \" No, I mean Thomas. \" _Mix_. \"But you said John before. \" _Mrs. B _. \" I know, but that was my first husband, and Thomas was my second, and I want a new headstone for each of them. Now, it seems to me, Mr. Mix, that where a person is buying more than one, that way, you ought to make some reduction in the price--throw something off. Though, of course, I want a pretty good article at all the graves. Not anything gorgeous, but neat and tasteful and calculated to please the eye. Mr. Smyth was not a man who was fond of show. Give him a thing comfortable, and he was satisfied. Now, which do you think is the prettiest, to have the name in raised letters in a straight line over the top of the stone, or just to cut the words 'Alexander P. Smyth' in a kind of a semicircle in sunken letters? \" _Mix_. \" Did I understand you to say Alexander P.? Were you referring to John or Thomas? \" _ Mrs. B _. \" Of course not. Aleck was my third. I'm not going to neglect his grave while I'm fixing up the rest. I wish to make a complete job of it, Mr. Mix, while I am about it, and I'm willing for you to undertake it if you are reasonable in your charges . Now, what'll you ask me for the lot, the kind I've described, plain but substantial, and sunk about two feet I should think, at the head of each grave? What'll you charge me for them--for the whole four? \" _Mix_. \"Well, I'll put you in those three headstones--\" [Illustration: A TOMBSTONE CONTRACT] _Mrs. B. \"Four_ headstones, Mr. Mix, not three. \" _Mix_. \"Four, was it? No; there was John and Thomas and Alexander P. That's all you said, I think. Only three. \" _Mrs. B _. \" Why, I want one for Adolph too, as a matter of course, the same as the others. I thought you knew I wanted one for Adolph, one made just like John's, only with the name different. Adolph was my fourth husband. He died about three years after I buried Philip, and I'm wearing mourning for him now. Now, please give me your prices for the whole of them. \" _Mix_. \"Well, madam, I want to be as reasonable as I can, and I tell you what I'll do. You give me all your work in the future, and I'll put you in those five headstones at hardly anything above cost; say--\" _Mrs. B _. \"_ Four _ headstones, not five. \" _Mix_. \" I think you mentioned five. \" _Mrs. B _. \" No; only four. \" _Mix_. \" Less see: there was John, and Thomas and Aleck, and Adolph and Philip. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Yes, but Aleck and Philip were the same one. His middle name was Philip, and I always called him by it. \" _Mix_. \"Mrs. Banger, I'll be much obliged to you if you'll tell me precisely how many husbands you have planted up in that cemetery lot. This thing 's getting a little mixed. \" _Mrs. B _. \"What do you mean, sir, by saying planted? I never 'planted' anybody. It 's disgraceful to use such language. \" _Mix_. \" It 's a technical term, madam. We always use it, and I don't see as it's going to hurt any old row of fellows named Smyth. Planted is good enough for other men, and it's good enough for them. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Old row of--What d'you mean, you impudent vagabond? I wouldn't let you put a headstone on one of my graves if you'd do it for nothing. \" Then Mrs. Banger flounced out of the shop, and Mix called after her as she went through the door, \"Lemme know when you go for another man, and I'll throw him in a tombstone for a wedding-present He'll want it soon. \" Mrs. Banger subsequently procured the services of a person in the city, and she regards Mr. Mix with something like detestation. But Mrs. Banger herself is not universally beloved. Colonel Coffin knows of one woman who despises her methods and desires her complete repression. A short time after the election of the colonel to the Legislature a lady called to see him at his law-office. When she had closed the door, she sat down and said, \"Colonel, my name is Mooney. I am unmarried--a single woman. I called to see you in reference to pushing a bill through the Legislature for the benefit of maiden ladies such as myself. Let me direct your attention to some extraordinary facts. Statistics tell us that in the entire population of the world there are one-fourth more women than men. In this country the proportion of women to men is slightly larger . In this State there are two and one-eighth women to every man. Now, this outrageous condition of affairs--\" \"Excuse me for a moment, madam,\" said the colonel. \" Really, the Legislature can do nothing to improve the matter. It cannot regulate the proportion of the sexes by law . \" \"I know it,\" replied Miss Mooney. \"That is not what I am coming at. I say that this condition of affairs is grossly unjust. If I had had the management of it, and had been compelled to arrange that there should be more women than men, I certainly should not have had any fractions. There are not only two women for every man, but an eighth of a woman besides, so that ever so many of us women would each belong to eight different men if a fair distribution were made. How do I know, for instance, that an eighth of me does not belong to you? Why, I don't know it; and I say it 's awful. \" \" If such is the case, madam,\" said the colonel, \"I surrender all my rights without waiting for a legislative enactment. \" \"Excuse me,\" replied Miss Mooney, \"but you do not catch the drift of my remarks. Of course, while the laws against bigamy are in existence, some of those women can never be married, although for my part, when a man has two wives and an eighth of another wife, I call it polygamy. Well, now, the point I want to make is this: When more than half of us can't marry, it's only right that the other half should have a fair chance. There are not men enough to go round, any how, and for gracious' sake let 's make them go as far as they honestly will . Well, then, how'll we do it? How'll we make an equitable distribution of those men ? \" \"Hanged if I know, madam . The Legislature daren't meddle with them. \" \"I'll tell you how to do it. Listen to me. Shut down on the widows. You hear me! Suppress the widows. Make it death for any widow to marry again. That's my remedy; and there'll never be any justice till it's the law. Just look at it! When a woman has been married once, she's had more than her share of the male population; she's had her own share and the share of another woman and an eighth. Is it right, is it honorable, for that woman to go and marry another man, and take the share of two more women and an eighth? I say, is it just the thing? \" \"Well, on the surface it does look a little crooked. \" \" Crooked is not the word. Colonel Coffin, I know these widows. I have had my eye on them. They've got a way of bursting into a man's feelings and walking off with his affections that fills a modest woman like me with gall and bitterness. You know Mrs. Banger? No? Well, now, look at her, f'r instance. First she married Mr. Smyth, although what on earth he",

But no matter; I s'pose I can go round and borrow elsewhere. Good-morning; drop in some time, and I'll show you that casket. \" As Toombs was going out he met Mr. Banger at the door. When he was gone, Banger said, \"My dear, who is that very odd-looking man? \" And Mrs. Banger hesitated a moment, turned very red, and answered, \"That is--that man is--a--a--he is, I believe--a--a--a--a some kind of a--an undertaker. \" Then Banger looked gloomy and went up stairs to ponder. But Mrs. Banger felt that she had a duty to perform in taking care that the lot in the cemetery should not fall into such disorder as Mr. Toombs had indicated, and she resolved to call upon Mr. Mix, at his monumental marble-works, to get him to attend to the matter for her. Mr. Mix did not know her, and his ignorance of her past history turned out to be unfortunate. The following conversation occurred between them: _Mrs. Banger_. \"Mr. Mix, I am anxious to have my cemetery lot fixed up--to put in new tombstones and reset the railing ; and I called to see if I could make some satisfactory arrangement with you. \" _Mix_. \"Certainly, madam. Tell me precisely what it is you want done. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Well, I'd like to have a new tombstone put over the grave of John--my husband, you know--and to have a nice inscription cut in it, 'Here lies John Smyth,' etc., etc. You know what I mean; the usual way, of course, and maybe some kind of a design on the stone like a broken rosebud or something . \" _Mix_. \"I understand. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Well, then, what'll you charge me for getting up a headstone just like that, out of pretty good white marble, and with a little picture of a torch upside down or a weeping angel on it, and the name of Thomas Smith cut on it? \" _Mix_. \" John Smyth, you mean. \" _ Mrs. B _. \" No, I mean Thomas. \" _Mix_. \"But you said John before. \" _Mrs. B _. \" I know, but that was my first husband, and Thomas was my second, and I want a new headstone for each of them. Now, it seems to me, Mr. Mix, that where a person is buying more than one, that way, you ought to make some reduction in the price--throw something off. Though, of course, I want a pretty good article at all the graves. Not anything gorgeous, but neat and tasteful and calculated to please the eye. Mr. Smyth was not a man who was fond of show. Give him a thing comfortable, and he was satisfied. Now, which do you think is the prettiest, to have the name in raised letters in a straight line over the top of the stone, or just to cut the words 'Alexander P. Smyth' in a kind of a semicircle in sunken letters? \" _Mix_. \" Did I understand you to say Alexander P.? Were you referring to John or Thomas? \" _ Mrs. B _. \" Of course not. Aleck was my third. I'm not going to neglect his grave while I'm fixing up the rest. I wish to make a complete job of it, Mr. Mix, while I am about it, and I'm willing for you to undertake it if you are reasonable in your charges . Now, what'll you ask me for the lot, the kind I've described, plain but substantial, and sunk about two feet I should think, at the head of each grave? What'll you charge me for them--for the whole four? \" _Mix_. \"Well, I'll put you in those three headstones--\" [Illustration: A TOMBSTONE CONTRACT] _Mrs. B. \"Four_ headstones, Mr. Mix, not three. \" _Mix_. \"Four, was it? No; there was John and Thomas and Alexander P. That's all you said, I think. Only three. \" _Mrs. B _. \" Why, I want one for Adolph too, as a matter of course, the same as the others. I thought you knew I wanted one for Adolph, one made just like John's, only with the name different. Adolph was my fourth husband. He died about three years after I buried Philip, and I'm wearing mourning for him now. Now, please give me your prices for the whole of them. \" _Mix_. \"Well, madam, I want to be as reasonable as I can, and I tell you what I'll do. You give me all your work in the future, and I'll put you in those five headstones at hardly anything above cost; say--\" _Mrs. B _. \"_ Four _ headstones, not five. \" _Mix_. \" I think you mentioned five. \" _Mrs. B _. \" No; only four. \" _Mix_. \" Less see: there was John, and Thomas and Aleck, and Adolph and Philip. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Yes, but Aleck and Philip were the same one. His middle name was Philip, and I always called him by it. \" _Mix_. \"Mrs. Banger, I'll be much obliged to you if you'll tell me precisely how many husbands you have planted up in that cemetery lot. This thing 's getting a little mixed. \" _Mrs. B _. \"What do you mean, sir, by saying planted? I never 'planted' anybody. It 's disgraceful to use such language. \" _Mix_. \" It 's a technical term, madam. We always use it, and I don't see as it's going to hurt any old row of fellows named Smyth. Planted is good enough for other men, and it's good enough for them. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Old row of--What d'you mean, you impudent vagabond? I wouldn't let you put a headstone on one of my graves if you'd do it for nothing. \" Then Mrs. Banger flounced out of the shop, and Mix called after her as she went through the door, \"Lemme know when you go for another man, and I'll throw him in a tombstone for a wedding-present He'll want it soon. \" Mrs. Banger subsequently procured the services of a person in the city, and she regards Mr. Mix with something like detestation. But Mrs. Banger herself is not universally beloved. Colonel Coffin knows of one woman who despises her methods and desires her complete repression. A short time after the election of the colonel to the Legislature a lady called to see him at his law-office. When she had closed the door, she sat down and said, \"Colonel, my name is Mooney. I am unmarried--a single woman. I called to see you in reference to pushing a bill through the Legislature for the benefit of maiden ladies such as myself. Let me direct your attention to some extraordinary facts. Statistics tell us that in the entire population of the world there are one-fourth more women than men. In this country the proportion of women to men is slightly larger . In this State there are two and one-eighth women to every man. Now, this outrageous condition of affairs--\" \"Excuse me for a moment, madam,\" said the colonel. \" Really, the Legislature can do nothing to improve the matter.

But no matter; I s'pose I can go round and borrow elsewhere. Good-morning; drop in some time, and I'll show you that casket. \" As Toombs was going out he met Mr. Banger at the door. When he was gone, Banger said, \"My dear, who is that very odd-looking man? \" And Mrs. Banger hesitated a moment, turned very red, and answered, \"That is--that man is--a--a--he is, I believe--a--a--a--a some kind of a--an undertaker. \" Then Banger looked gloomy and went up stairs to ponder. But Mrs. Banger felt that she had a duty to perform in taking care that the lot in the cemetery should not fall into such disorder as Mr. Toombs had indicated, and she resolved to call upon Mr. Mix, at his monumental marble-works, to get him to attend to the matter for her. Mr. Mix did not know her, and his ignorance of her past history turned out to be unfortunate. The following conversation occurred between them: _Mrs. Banger_. \"Mr. Mix, I am anxious to have my cemetery lot fixed up--to put in new tombstones and reset the railing ; and I called to see if I could make some satisfactory arrangement with you. \" _Mix_. \"Certainly, madam. Tell me precisely what it is you want done. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Well, I'd like to have a new tombstone put over the grave of John--my husband, you know--and to have a nice inscription cut in it, 'Here lies John Smyth,' etc., etc. You know what I mean; the usual way, of course, and maybe some kind of a design on the stone like a broken rosebud or something . \" _Mix_. \"I understand. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Well, then, what'll you charge me for getting up a headstone just like that, out of pretty good white marble, and with a little picture of a torch upside down or a weeping angel on it, and the name of Thomas Smith cut on it? \" _Mix_. \" John Smyth, you mean. \" _ Mrs. B _. \" No, I mean Thomas. \" _Mix_. \"But you said John before. \" _Mrs. B _. \" I know, but that was my first husband, and Thomas was my second, and I want a new headstone for each of them. Now, it seems to me, Mr. Mix, that where a person is buying more than one, that way, you ought to make some reduction in the price--throw something off. Though, of course, I want a pretty good article at all the graves. Not anything gorgeous, but neat and tasteful and calculated to please the eye. Mr. Smyth was not a man who was fond of show. Give him a thing comfortable, and he was satisfied. Now, which do you think is the prettiest, to have the name in raised letters in a straight line over the top of the stone, or just to cut the words 'Alexander P. Smyth' in a kind of a semicircle in sunken letters? \" _Mix_. \" Did I understand you to say Alexander P.? Were you referring to John or Thomas? \" _ Mrs. B _. \" Of course not. Aleck was my third. I'm not going to neglect his grave while I'm fixing up the rest. I wish to make a complete job of it, Mr. Mix, while I am about it, and I'm willing for you to undertake it if you are reasonable in your charges . Now, what'll you ask me for the lot, the kind I've described, plain but substantial, and sunk about two feet I should think, at the head of each grave? What'll you charge me for them--for the whole four? \" _Mix_. \"Well, I'll put you in those three headstones--\" [Illustration: A TOMBSTONE CONTRACT] _Mrs. B. \"Four_ headstones, Mr. Mix, not three. \" _Mix_. \"Four, was it? No; there was John and Thomas and Alexander P. That's all you said, I think. Only three. \" _Mrs. B _. \" Why, I want one for Adolph too, as a matter of course, the same as the others. I thought you knew I wanted one for Adolph, one made just like John's, only with the name different. Adolph was my fourth husband. He died about three years after I buried Philip, and I'm wearing mourning for him now. Now, please give me your prices for the whole of them. \" _Mix_. \"Well, madam, I want to be as reasonable as I can, and I tell you what I'll do. You give me all your work in the future, and I'll put you in those five headstones at hardly anything above cost; say--\" _Mrs. B _. \"_ Four _ headstones, not five. \" _Mix_. \" I think you mentioned five. \" _Mrs. B _. \" No; only four. \" _Mix_. \" Less see: there was John, and Thomas and Aleck, and Adolph and Philip. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Yes, but Aleck and Philip were the same one. His middle name was Philip, and I always called him by it. \" _Mix_. \"Mrs. Banger, I'll be much obliged to you if you'll tell me precisely how many husbands you have planted up in that cemetery lot. This thing 's getting a little mixed. \" _Mrs. B _. \"What do you mean, sir, by saying planted? I never 'planted' anybody. It 's disgraceful to use such language. \" _Mix_. \" It 's a technical term, madam. We always use it, and I don't see as it's going to hurt any old row of fellows named Smyth. Planted is good enough for other men, and it's good enough for them. \" _Mrs. B _. \"Old row of--What d'you mean, you impudent vagabond? I wouldn't let you put a headstone on one of my graves if you'd do it for nothing. \" Then Mrs. Banger flounced out of the shop, and Mix called after her as she went through the door, \"Lemme know when you go for another man, and I'll throw him in a tombstone for a wedding-present He'll want it soon. \" Mrs. Banger subsequently procured the services of a person in the city, and she regards Mr. Mix with something like detestation. But Mrs. Banger herself is not universally beloved. Colonel Coffin knows of one woman who despises her methods and desires her complete repression. A short time after the election of the colonel to the Legislature a lady called to see him at his law-office. When she had closed the door, she sat down and said, \"Colonel, my name is Mooney. I am unmarried--a single woman. I called to see you in reference to pushing a bill through the Legislature for the benefit of maiden ladies such as myself. Let me direct your attention to some extraordinary facts. Statistics tell us that in the entire population of the world there are one-fourth more women than men. In this country the proportion of women to men is slightly larger . In this State there are two and one-eighth women to every man. Now, this outrageous condition of affairs--\" \"Excuse me for a moment, madam,\" said the colonel. \" Really, the Legislature can do nothing to improve the matter. It cannot regulate the proportion of the sexes by law . \" \"I know it,\" replied Miss Mooney. \"That is not what I am coming at. I say that this condition of affairs is grossly unjust. If I had had the management of it, and had been compelled to arrange that there should be more women than men, I certainly should not have had any fractions. There are not only two women for every man, but an eighth of a woman besides, so that ever so many of us women would each belong to eight different men if a fair distribution were made. How do I know, for instance, that an eighth of me does not belong to you? Why, I don't know it; and I say it 's awful. \" \" If such is the case, madam,\" said the colonel, \"I surrender all my rights without waiting for a legislative enactment. \" \"Excuse me,\" replied Miss Mooney, \"but you do not catch the drift of my remarks. Of course, while the laws against bigamy are in existence, some of those women can never be married, although for my part, when a man has two wives and an eighth of another wife, I call it polygamy. Well, now, the point I want to make is this: When more than half of us can't marry, it's only right that the other half should have a fair chance. There are not men enough to go round, any how, and for gracious' sake let 's make them go as far as they honestly will . Well, then, how'll we do it? How'll we make an equitable distribution of those men ? \" \"Hanged if I know, madam . The Legislature daren't meddle with them. \" \"I'll tell you how to do it. Listen to me. Shut down on the widows. You hear me! Suppress the widows. Make it death for any widow to marry again. That's my remedy; and there'll never be any justice till it's the law. Just look at it! When a woman has been married once, she's had more than her share of the male population; she's had her own share and the share of another woman and an eighth. Is it right, is it honorable, for that woman to go and marry another man, and take the share of two more women and an eighth? I say, is it just the thing? \" \"Well, on the surface it does look a little crooked. \" \" Crooked is not the word. Colonel Coffin, I know these widows. I have had my eye on them. They've got a way of bursting into a man's feelings and walking off with his affections that fills a modest woman like me with gall and bitterness. You know Mrs. Banger? No? Well, now, look at her, f'r instance. First she married Mr. Smyth, although what on earth he",

The wind also tore up the felt and blew it over the edge, so that it hung down over the front of the house like a curtain . Of course it made the rooms pitch-dark, and I did not get up until one o'clock in the afternoon, but lay there wondering how it was the night seemed so long. \"Then I had a tin roof put on, and it did well enough for a while. But whenever there was a heavy rain or the wind was high, it used to rattle all night with a noise like the battle of Gettysburg. At last it began to leak, and a tinner sent a man around to find the hole. He spent a week on that roof, and he spread half a ton of solder over it, but still it leaked. And finally, when the snow came, the water trickled down the wall and ran into an eight-hundred-dollar piano, which will be closed out at a low figure to anybody who wants mahogany kindling-wood. When the tin was removed and the new slate roof was put on, the slates used to get loose and slide down on the head of the hired girl while she was hanging up the clothes. And when the man came to replace the slates, he plunged off the roof and broke four ribs and his leg, whereupon he sued me for damages. And while the case was pending in court a snow-storm came. The snow blew in under the slates, and my oldest boy spent the day with some of his friends snow-balling and sledding in the garret. Then the snow on the garret floor melted and wet the wall-paper down stairs, so that the house became frightfully damp, and we had to move over to the hotel for a fortnight. \"Then I tried the 'Patent Incombustible' roofing, because the man said it would not only keep out the rain, but it was perfectly fireproof.

The man who chooses to seek may find original characters, queer combinations of events, surprising revelations of individual and family experiences and an unlimited fund of amusement, especially if he is disposed, perhaps even while he submits to an overpowering conviction that all life is tragic, to summon into prominence those humorous phases of social existence which, as in the best of artificial tragedies, are permitted to appear in real life as the foil of that which is truly sorrowful. To depict events that are simply amusing may not be the highest and best function of a writer; but if he has a strong impulse to undertake such a task in the intervals of more serious work, it may be that he performs a duty which is more obvious because the common inclination of those who tell the story of human life is to present that which is sad and terrible, and to lead-the reader, whose soul has bitterness enough of its own, into contemplation of the true or fictitious anguish of others.",

If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith. And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example.",

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion. If it is filled with nonsense, that nonsense at any rate is innocent. It is modest, cleanly and without malice or irreverence. A worthier and nobler work might have been written; a purer work could not have been. What its other merits are he who reads it will discern. To apologize for it in any manner would be to admit that it has grave deficiencies, and such an admission the author would not make even if his conscience impelled him to do so. The book is offered to the reader with the conviction that if the man who laughs is the happiest man, it may contribute something to the sum of human felicity. The story of the French horn, related in the twentieth chapter, will recall to the reader of the \"Sparrowgrass Papers\" an incident related in that most charming book of humor. Perhaps it ought to be said that the former narrative was at least suggested by the latter. The artist who has illustrated the book, Mr. Arthur B. Frost, deserves to have it said of him that he has done his work skilfully, tastefully and with nice appreciation of the humor of the various situations. CONTENTS CHAPTER I.

BALLAST MAJOR SLOTT 'S TIGER FACING THE TIGER CHAPTER I. PROLOGUE. _THE ADVANTAGES OF ELBOW-ROOM_. The professors of sociology, in exploring the mysteries of the science of human living, have not agreed that elbow-room is one of the great needs of modern civilized society, but this may be because they have not yet reached the bottom of things and discovered the truth. In crowded communities men have chances of development in certain directions, but in others their growth is surely checked. A man who lives in a large city is apt to experience a sharpening of his wits, for attrition of minds as well as of pebbles produces polish and brilliancy; but perhaps this very process prevents the free unfolding of parts of his character. If his individuality is not partially lost amid the crowd, it is likely that, first, his imitative faculty will induce him to shape himself in accordance with another than his own pattern, and that, second, the dread of the conspicuousness which is the certain result of eccentricity will persuade him to avoid any tendency he may have to become strongly unlike his neighbors. The house that he lives in is tightly squeezed in a row of dwellings builded upon a precisely similar plan, so that the influence brought to bear upon him by the home resembles to some extent that which operates upon his fellows. There is a pressure upon both sides of him in the house; and when he plunges into business, there is a far greater pressure there, in the shape of sharp competition, which brings him into constant collision with other men, and mayhap drives him or compels him to drive his weaker rival to the wall. The city-man is likely to cover himself with a mantle of reserve and dissimulation. If he has a longing to wander in untrodden and devious paths, he is disposed resolutely to suppress his desire and to go in the beaten track. If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith. And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example. In smaller and less densely-populated communities the weight of public opinion is not largely decreased, but the pressure is not so great. There is more elbow-room. A man who knows everybody about him gauges with a reasonable degree of accuracy the characters of those who are to judge him, and is able to form a pretty fair estimate of the value of their opinions. When men can do this, they are apt to feel a greater degree of freedom in following their natural impulses. If men could sound the depths of all knowledge and read with ease the secrets of the universe, they might lose much of their reverence. When they know the exact worth of the judgment of their fellow-men, they begin to regard it with comparative indifference. And so, if a dweller in a small village desires to leave the beaten track, he can summon courage to do so with greater readiness than the man of the town . If he has occasionally that proneness to make a fool of himself which seizes every man now and then, he may indulge in the perilous luxury without great carefulness of the consequences . Smith 's ordinary conduct is the admiration of Jones as a regular thing; but when Smith switches off into some eccentricity for which Jones has no inclination, it is only a matter of course that Jones should indulge in his own little oddities without caring whether Smith smiles upon him or not.",

How in the thunder could he shoot bullets at her? \" \" I thought maybe he had a gun. But I don't understand any of it. It is the most astounding thing I ever heard of, at any rate. \" \"Now, my dear sir, I want to ask you how Longfellow _ could_ manage a gun? \" \"Why, as any other man does, of course. \" \"Man! man! Why, merciful Moses! you didn't think I was talking about human beings all this time, did you? Why, Longfellow is a horse! They were racing--running races over at the course this afternoon; and I was trying to tell you about it. \" \" You don't say? \" remarked the doctor, with a sigh of relief. \"Well, I declare, I thought you were speaking of the poet, and I hardly knew whether to believe you or not; it seemed so strange that he should behave in that manner. \" Then Mr. Butterwick went into the smoking-car to tell the joke to his friends, and the doctor sat reflecting upon the outrageous impudence of the men who name their horses after respectable people. While he was thinking about it, another sensational occurrence attracted his attention . A man sitting in the same car with the doctor had placed a bottle of tomato catsup neck downward in the rack above his seat. Presently a friend came in, and in a few moments the friend, who was cutting his finger-nails with a knife, introduced the subject of the races. The discussion gradually became warm, and as the excitement increased the man with the knife gesticulated violently with the hand containing the weapon while he explained his views. Meantime, the cork jolted out of the bottle overhead, and the catsup dripped down over the owner 's head and coat and collar without his perceiving the fact. [Illustration: AN EXCITED OLD LADY] Soon a nervous old lady on the back seat caught sight of the red stain, and imagining it was blood, instantly began to scream \"Murder! \" at the top of her voice. As the passengers, conductor and brakemen rushed up she brandished her umbrella wildly and exclaimed, \"Arrest that man there! Arrest that willin! I see him do it. I see him stab that other one with his knife until the blood spurted out . Oh, you wretch! Oh, you willinous rascal, to take human life in that scandalous manner! I see you punch him with the knife, you butcher, you! and I'll swear it agin you in court, too, you owdacious rascal! \" They took her into the rear car and soothed her, while the victim wiped the catsup off his coat. But that venerable old woman will go down to the silent grave with the conviction that she witnessed in those cars one of the most awful and sanguinary encounters that has occurred since the affair between Cain and Abel. * * * * * Dr. Dox recently was called upon to settle a bet upon a much more serious matter than a horse-race. During a religious controversy between Peter Lamb and some of his friends one of the latter asserted that Peter didn't know who was the mother-in-law of Moses, and that he couldn't ascertain. Peter offered to bet that he could find out, and the wager was accepted. After searching in vain through the Scriptures, Mr. Lamb concluded to go around and interview Deacon Jones about it. The deacon is head-man in the gas-office, and in the office there are half a dozen small windows, behind which sit clerks to receive money. Applying at one of these, Mr. Lamb said, \"Is Deacon Jones in? \" \"What 's your business? \" \"Why, I want to find out the name of Moses'--\" \" Don't know anything about it . Look in the directory;\" and the clerk slammed the window shut. Then Peter went to the next window and said, \"I want to see Mr. Jones a minute. \" \" What for? \" \" I want to see if he knows Moses'--\" \"Moses who? \" \" Why, Moses, the Bible Moses-- if he knows--\" \"Patriarchs don't belong in this department. Apply across the street at the Christian Association rooms;\" and then the clerk closed the window. At the next window Mr. Lamb said, \"I want to see Deacon Jones a minute in reference to a matter about Moses. \" \"Want to pay his gas-bill? What's the last name? \" \" Oh no. I mean the first Moses, the original one. \" \" Anything the matter with his meter? \" \" You don't understand me. I refer to",

Why, merciful Moses! you didn't think I was talking about human beings all this time, did you? Why, Longfellow is a horse!

While he was thinking about it, another sensational occurrence attracted his attention . A man sitting in the same car with the doctor had placed a bottle of tomato catsup neck downward in the rack above his seat. Presently a friend came in, and in a few moments the friend, who was cutting his finger-nails with a knife, introduced the subject of the races. The discussion gradually became warm, and as the excitement increased the man with the knife gesticulated violently with the hand containing the weapon while he explained his views. Meantime, the cork jolted out of the bottle overhead, and the catsup dripped down over the owner 's head and coat and collar without his perceiving the fact. [Illustration: AN EXCITED OLD LADY] Soon a nervous old lady on the back seat caught sight of the red stain, and imagining it was blood, instantly began to scream \"Murder! \" at the top of her voice. As the passengers, conductor and brakemen rushed up she brandished her umbrella wildly and exclaimed, \"Arrest that man there! Arrest that willin! I see him do it. I see him stab that other one with his knife until the blood spurted out . Oh, you wretch! Oh, you willinous rascal, to take human life in that scandalous manner! I see you punch him with the knife, you butcher, you! and I'll swear it agin you in court, too, you owdacious rascal! \" They took her into the rear car and soothed her, while the victim wiped the catsup off his coat. But that venerable old woman will go down to the silent grave with the conviction that she witnessed in those cars one of the most awful and sanguinary encounters that has occurred since the affair between Cain and Abel. * * * * * Dr. Dox recently was called upon to settle a bet upon a much more serious matter than a horse-race. During a religious controversy between Peter Lamb and some of his friends one of the latter asserted that Peter didn't know who was the mother-in-law of Moses, and that he couldn't ascertain. Peter offered to bet that he could find out, and the wager was accepted. After searching in vain through the Scriptures, Mr. Lamb concluded to go around and interview Deacon Jones about it. The deacon is head-man in the gas-office, and in the office there are half a dozen small windows, behind which sit clerks to receive money. Applying at one of these, Mr. Lamb said, \"Is Deacon Jones in? \" \"What 's your business? \" \"Why, I want to find out the name of Moses'--\" \" Don't know anything about it . Look in the directory;\" and the clerk slammed the window shut. Then Peter went to the next window and said, \"I want to see Mr. Jones a minute. \" \" What for? \" \" I want to see if he knows Moses'--\" \"Moses who? \" \" Why, Moses, the Bible Moses-- if he knows--\" \"Patriarchs don't belong in this department. Apply across the street at the Christian Association rooms;\" and then the clerk closed the window. At the next window Mr. Lamb said, \"I want to see Deacon Jones a minute in reference to a matter about Moses. \" \"Want to pay his gas-bill? What's the last name? \" \" Oh no. I mean the first Moses, the original one. \" \" Anything the matter with his meter? \" \" You don't understand me. I refer to",

While he was thinking about it, another sensational occurrence attracted his attention . A man sitting in the same car with the doctor had placed a bottle of tomato catsup neck downward in the rack above his seat. Presently a friend came in, and in a few moments the friend, who was cutting his finger-nails with a knife, introduced the subject of the races. The discussion gradually became warm, and as the excitement increased the man with the knife gesticulated violently with the hand containing the weapon while he explained his views. Meantime, the cork jolted out of the bottle overhead, and the catsup dripped down over the owner 's head and coat and collar without his perceiving the fact. [Illustration: AN EXCITED OLD LADY] Soon a nervous old lady on the back seat caught sight of the red stain, and imagining it was blood, instantly began to scream \"Murder! \" at the top of her voice. As the passengers, conductor and brakemen rushed up she brandished her umbrella wildly and exclaimed, \"Arrest that man there! Arrest that willin! I see him do it. I see him stab that other one with his knife until the blood spurted out . Oh, you wretch! Oh, you willinous rascal, to take human life in that scandalous manner! I see you punch him with the knife, you butcher, you! and I'll swear it agin you in court, too, you owdacious rascal! \" They took her into the rear car and soothed her, while the victim wiped the catsup off his coat. But that venerable old woman will go down to the silent grave with the conviction that she witnessed in those cars one of the most awful and sanguinary encounters that has occurred since the affair between Cain and Abel. * * * * * Dr. Dox recently was called upon to settle a bet upon a much more serious matter than a horse-race. During a religious controversy between Peter Lamb and some of his friends one of the latter asserted that Peter didn't know who was the mother-in-law of Moses, and that he couldn't ascertain. Peter offered to bet that he could find out, and the wager was accepted. After searching in vain through the Scriptures, Mr. Lamb concluded to go around and interview Deacon Jones about it. The deacon is head-man in the gas-office, and in the office there are half a dozen small windows, behind which sit clerks to receive money. Applying at one of these, Mr. Lamb said, \"Is Deacon Jones in? \" \"What 's your business? \" \"Why, I want to find out the name of Moses'--\" \" Don't know anything about it . Look in the directory;\" and the clerk slammed the window shut. Then Peter went to the next window and said, \"I want to see Mr. Jones a minute. \" \" What for? \" \" I want to see if he knows Moses'--\" \"Moses who? \" \" Why, Moses, the Bible Moses-- if he knows--\" \"Patriarchs don't belong in this department. Apply across the street at the Christian Association rooms;\" and then the clerk closed the window. At the next window Mr. Lamb said, \"I want to see Deacon Jones a minute in reference to a matter about Moses. \" \"Want to pay his gas-bill? What's the last name? \" \" Oh no. I mean the first Moses, the original one. \" \" Anything the matter with his meter? \" \" You don't understand me. I refer to",

He read somewhere the other day that two drops of the essential oil of tobacco placed upon the tongue of a cat would kill the animal instantly. He did not believe it, and he concluded to try the experiment to see if it was so. Old Squills, the druggist, has a cat weighing about fifteen pounds, and Mr. Lamb, taking the animal into the back room, shut the door, opened the cat's mouth, and applied the poison. One moment later a wild, unearthly \"M-e-e-e-e-ow-ow-ow! \" was emitted by the cat, and, to Mr. Lamb's intense alarm, the animal began swishing around the room with hair on end and tail in convulsive excitement, screeching like a fog-whistle. Mr. Lamb is not certain, but he considers it a fair estimate to say that the cat made the entire circuit of the room, over chairs and under tables, seventy-four times every minute, and he is willing to swear to seventy times, without counting the occasional diversions made by the brute for the purpose of snatching at Mr. Lamb's pantaloons and hair. Just as Mr. Lamb had about made up his mind that the cat would conclude the gymnastic exercises by eating him, the animal dashed through the glass sash of the door into the shop, whisked two jars of licorice root and tooth-brushes off the counter, tore out the ipecac-bottle and four jugs of hair-dye, smashed a bottle of \" Balm of Peru,\" alighted on the bonnet of a woman who was drinking soda-water, and after a few convulsions rolled over into a soap-box and died. Mr. Lamb is now satisfied that a cat actually can be killed in the manner aforementioned, but he would be better satisfied if old Squills didn't insist upon collecting from him the price of those drugs and the glass sash. * * * * * Last summer Peter 's brother spent a few weeks with him. He owned a \"pistol cane,\" which he carried about with him loaded; but when he went away, he accidentally left it behind, and without explaining to Peter that it was different from ordinary canes. So, one afternoon a few days later, Peter went out to Keyser's farm to look at some stock, and he picked up the cane to take along with him. When he got to Keyser's, the latter went to the barnyard to show him an extraordinary kind of a new pig that he had developed by cross-breeding. \"Now that pig,\" said Keyser, \"just lays over all the other pigs on the Atlantic Slope. Take him any way you please, he's the most gorgeous pig anywheres around. Fat! Why, he's all fat! There 's no lean in him. He ain't anything but a solid mass of lard. Put that pig near a fire, and in twenty minutes his naked skeleton'd be standing there in a puddle of grease. That's a positive fact. Now, you just feel his shoulder. \" Then Peter lifted up his cane and gave the pig a poke. He poked it two or three times, and he had just remarked, \"That certainly is a splendid pig,\" when he gave it another poke, and then somehow the pistol in the cane went off and the pig rolled over and expired. [Illustration: HOW THE PIG WAS KILLED] \"What in the mischief d'you do that for? \" exclaimed Keyser, amazed and indignant. \"Do it for? _ I _ didn't do it! This cane must've been made out of an old gun-barrel with the load left in. I never had the least idea, I pledge _you _ my word , that there was anything the matter with it. \" \" That 's pretty thin,\" said Keyser; \"you had a grudge agin that pig because you couldn't scare up a pig like him, and you killed him on purpose. \" \" That 's perfectly ridiculous. \" \"Oh, maybe it is. You'll just fork over two hundred dollars for that piece of pork, if you please. \" \"I'll see you in Egypt first. \" * * * * * Peter whipped ; but if Keyser _did_ give in first, Peter went home with a bleeding nose, and the next day he was arrested for killing the pig. The case is coming up soon, and Peter's brother is on, ready to testify about that cane. Peter himself walks now with a hickory stick. CHAPTER XIV. _ RESPECTING CERTAIN SAVAGES _. When young Mr. Spooner, Judge Twiddler's nephew, left college, he made up his mind to enter the ministry and become a missionary. One day he met Captain Hubbs; and when he mentioned that he thought of going out as a missionary, Captain Hubbs asked him, \"Where are you going? \" _S_. \"To the Navigator Islands. I sail in October. \" _Capt_. (shaking his head mournfully). \"Pore young man! Pore young man! It is too bad--too bad indeed! Going to the Navigator Islands! Not married yet, I reckon? No? Ah! so much the better. No wife and children to make widows and orphans of. But it's sad, anyway. A promising young fellow like you! My heart bleeds for you. \" _S_. \"What d'you mean?\" _Capt_. \"Oh, nothing. I don't want to frighten you. I know you're doing it from a sense of duty. But I've been there to the Navigator Islands, and I'm acquainted with the people's little ways, and I--well, I--I--the fact is, you see, that--well, sooner'n disguise the truth, I don't mind telling you straight out that the last day I was there the folks et one of my legs--sawed it off an' et it. Now you can see how things are yourself. Those Navigators gobbled that leg right up. It was a leg a good deal like yours, only heavier, I reckon. \" _S_. \"You astonish me! \" _Capt. _ \"Oh, that's nothing. They did that just for a little bit of fun. The chief told me the day before that they never et anything but human beings. He said his family consumed about three a day all the year round, counting holidays and Sundays. He was a light eater himself, he said, on account of gitting dyspepsia from a tough Australian that he et in 1847, but the girls and the old woman, so he said, were very hearty eaters, and it kept him busy prowling around after human beings to satisfy 'em. The old woman, he said, rather preferred to eat babies, on account of her teeth being poor, but the girls could eat the grizzliest sailor that ever went aboard ship. \" _S_. \" This is frightful. \" _Capt_. \" And the chief said sometimes the supply was scarce, but lately they had begun to depend more on imported goods than on the home products. And they were better, anyhow, for all the folks preferred white meat. He said the missionary societies were shipping them some nice lots of provender, and the tears came in his eyes when he said how good they were to the poor friendless savage away on a distant island.

I want to know who was the mother-in-law of Moses. \" \" Oh yes; certainly. Excuse me; I thought you were inquiring about roses. The law of Moses was the foundation of the religion of the Jews. You can find it in full in the Pentateuch. It is admirable--very admirable--for the purpose for which it was ordained. We, of course, have outlived that dispensation, but it still contains many things that are useful to us, as, for instance, the--\" \"Was Moses married? \" shrieked Mr. Lamb. \"Married? Oh, yes; the name of his father-in-law, you know, was Jethro, and--\" \"Who was his wife? \" \"Why, she was the daughter of Jethro, of course. I said Jethro was his father-in-law. \" \" No; Jethro's wife, I mean. I want to know to settle a bet. \" \" No, that wasn't her name. 'Bet' is a corruption of Elizabeth, and that name, I believe, is not found in the Old Testament. I don't remember what the name of Moses' wife was. \" \" I want to know what was the name of the mother-in-law of Moses , to settle a bet. \" \"Young man,\" said the old doctor, sternly, \"you are trifling with a serious subject. What do you mean by wanting Moses to settle a bet? \" Then Mr. Lamb rolled up a sheet of music that lay on the piano; and putting it to the doctor's ear, he shouted, \"I made--a--bet--that--I--could--find--out--what--the--name--ofMoses'--mother-in-law--was. Can--you--tell--me? \" \" The Bible don't say,\" responded the doctor; \"and unless you can get a spiritualist to put you in communication with Moses, I guess you will lose. \" Then Peter went around and handed over the stakes. Hereafter he will gamble on other than biblical games. * * * * * [Illustration: THE CAT SUCCUMBS] Mr. Lamb has an inquiring mind. He is always investigating something. He read somewhere the other day that two drops of the essential oil of tobacco placed upon the tongue of a cat would kill the animal instantly. He did not believe it, and he concluded to try the experiment to see if it was so. Old Squills, the druggist, has a cat weighing about fifteen pounds, and Mr. Lamb, taking the animal into the back room, shut the door, opened the cat's mouth, and applied the poison. One moment later a wild, unearthly \"M-e-e-e-e-ow-ow-ow! \" was emitted by the cat, and, to Mr. Lamb's intense alarm, the animal began swishing around the room with hair on end and tail in convulsive excitement, screeching like a fog-whistle. Mr. Lamb is not certain, but he considers it a fair estimate to say that the cat made the entire circuit of the room, over chairs and under tables, seventy-four times every minute, and he is willing to swear to seventy times, without counting the occasional diversions made by the brute for the purpose of snatching at Mr. Lamb's pantaloons and hair. Just as Mr. Lamb had about made up his mind that the cat would conclude the gymnastic exercises by eating him, the animal dashed through the glass sash of the door into the shop, whisked two jars of licorice root and tooth-brushes off the counter, tore out the ipecac-bottle and four jugs of hair-dye, smashed a bottle of \" Balm of Peru,\" alighted on the bonnet of a woman who was drinking soda-water, and after a few convulsions rolled over into a soap-box and died. Mr. Lamb is now satisfied that a cat actually can be killed in the manner aforementioned, but he would be better satisfied if old Squills didn't insist upon collecting from him the price of those drugs and the glass sash. * * * * * Last summer Peter 's brother spent a few weeks with him. He owned a \"pistol cane,\" which he carried about with him loaded; but when he went away, he accidentally left it behind, and without explaining to Peter that it was different from ordinary canes. So, one afternoon a few days later, Peter went out to Keyser's farm to look at some stock, and he picked up the cane to take along with him. When he got to Keyser's, the latter went to the barnyard to show him an extraordinary kind of a new pig that he had developed by cross-breeding. \"Now that pig,\" said Keyser, \"just lays over all the other pigs on the Atlantic Slope. Take him any way you please, he's the most gorgeous pig anywheres around. Fat! Why, he's all fat! There 's no lean in him. He ain't anything but a solid mass of lard. Put that pig near a fire, and in twenty minutes his naked skeleton'd be standing there in a puddle of grease. That's a positive fact. Now, you just feel his shoulder. \" Then Peter lifted up his cane and gave the pig a poke. He poked it two or three times, and he had just remarked, \"That certainly is a splendid pig,\" when he gave it another poke, and then somehow the pistol in the cane went off and the pig rolled over and expired. [Illustration: HOW THE PIG WAS KILLED] \"What in the mischief d'you do that for? \" exclaimed Keyser, amazed and indignant. \"Do it for? _ I _ didn't do it! This cane must've been made out of an old gun-barrel with the load left in. I never had the least idea, I pledge _you _ my word , that there was anything the matter with it. \" \" That 's pretty thin,\" said Keyser; \"you had a grudge agin that pig because you couldn't scare up a pig like him, and you killed him on purpose. \" \" That 's perfectly ridiculous. \" \"Oh, maybe it is. You'll just fork over two hundred dollars for that piece of pork, if you please. \" \"I'll see you in Egypt first. \" * * * * * Peter whipped ; but if Keyser _did_ give in first, Peter went home with a bleeding nose, and the next day he was arrested for killing the pig. The case is coming up soon, and Peter's brother is on, ready to testify about that cane. Peter himself walks now with a hickory stick. CHAPTER XIV. _ RESPECTING CERTAIN SAVAGES _. When young Mr. Spooner, Judge Twiddler's nephew, left college, he made up his mind to enter the ministry and become a missionary. One day he met Captain Hubbs; and when he mentioned that he thought of going out as a missionary, Captain Hubbs asked him, \"Where are you going? \" _S_. \"To the Navigator Islands. I sail in October. \" _Capt_. (shaking his head mournfully). \"Pore young man! Pore young man! It is too bad--too bad indeed! Going to the Navigator Islands! Not married yet, I reckon? No? Ah! so much the better. No wife and children to make widows and orphans of. But it's sad, anyway. A promising young fellow like you! My heart bleeds for you. \" _S_. \"What d'you mean?\" _Capt_. \"Oh, nothing. I don't want to frighten you. I know you're doing it from a sense of duty. But I've been there to the Navigator Islands, and I'm acquainted with the people's little ways, and I--well, I--I--the fact is, you see, that--well, sooner'n disguise the truth, I don't mind telling you straight out that the last day I was there the folks et one of my legs--sawed it off an' et it. Now you can see how things are yourself. Those Navigators gobbled that leg right up. It was a leg a good deal like yours, only heavier, I reckon. \" _S_. \"You astonish me! \" _Capt. _ \"Oh, that's nothing. They did that just for a little bit of fun. The chief told me the day before that they never et anything but human beings. He said his family consumed about three a day all the year round, counting holidays and Sundays. He was a light eater himself, he said, on account of gitting dyspepsia from a tough Australian that he et in 1847, but the girls and the old woman, so he said, were very hearty eaters, and it kept him busy prowling around after human beings to satisfy 'em. The old woman, he said, rather preferred to eat babies, on account of her teeth being poor, but the girls could eat the grizzliest sailor that ever went aboard ship. \" _S_. \" This is frightful. \" _Capt_. \" And the chief said sometimes the supply was scarce, but lately they had begun to depend more on imported goods than on the home products. And they were better, anyhow, for all the folks preferred white meat. He said the missionary societies were shipping them some nice lots of provender, and the tears came in his eyes when he said how good they were to the poor friendless savage away on a distant island. He said he liked a missionary not too old or too young. But let's see; what's your age, did you say? \" [Illustration: MR. SPOONER IS ALARMED] _S_. \"I am twenty-eight. \" _Capt. _ \" I think he mentioned twenty-seven; but howsomedever, he liked 'em old enough to be solid and young enough to be tender. And he said he liked missionaries because they never used rum or tobacco and always kept their flavor. I know I seen one young fellow who came out there from Boston . He got up a camp-meeting in the woods; and while he was giving out the hymn, one of the congregation banged him on the head with a club, and in less than no time he was sizzling over a fire right in front of the pulpit. They lit the fire with his hymn-book and kept her going with his sermons. He was a man just about your build--a little leaner'n you, maybe. And they like a man to be stoutish. He eats more tender. \" _S_. \" I had no idea that such awful practices existed. \" _Capt_. \" I haven't",

I want to know who was the mother-in-law of Moses. \" \" Oh yes; certainly. Excuse me; I thought you were inquiring about roses. The law of Moses was the foundation of the religion of the Jews. You can find it in full in the Pentateuch. It is admirable--very admirable--for the purpose for which it was ordained. We, of course, have outlived that dispensation, but it still contains many things that are useful to us, as, for instance, the--\" \"Was Moses married? \" shrieked Mr. Lamb. \"Married? Oh, yes; the name of his father-in-law, you know, was Jethro, and--\" \"Who was his wife? \" \"Why, she was the daughter of Jethro, of course. I said Jethro was his father-in-law. \" \" No; Jethro's wife, I mean. I want to know to settle a bet. \" \" No, that wasn't her name. 'Bet' is a corruption of Elizabeth, and that name, I believe, is not found in the Old Testament. I don't remember what the name of Moses' wife was. \" \" I want to know what was the name of the mother-in-law of Moses , to settle a bet. \" \"Young man,\" said the old doctor, sternly, \"you are trifling with a serious subject. What do you mean by wanting Moses to settle a bet? \" Then Mr. Lamb rolled up a sheet of music that lay on the piano; and putting it to the doctor's ear, he shouted, \"I made--a--bet--that--I--could--find--out--what--the--name--ofMoses'--mother-in-law--was. Can--you--tell--me? \" \" The Bible don't say,\" responded the doctor; \"and unless you can get a spiritualist to put you in communication with Moses, I guess you will lose. \" Then Peter went around and handed over the stakes. Hereafter he will gamble on other than biblical games. * * * * * [Illustration: THE CAT SUCCUMBS] Mr. Lamb has an inquiring mind. He is always investigating something. He read somewhere the other day that two drops of the essential oil of tobacco placed upon the tongue of a cat would kill the animal instantly. He did not believe it, and he concluded to try the experiment to see if it was so. Old Squills, the druggist, has a cat weighing about fifteen pounds, and Mr. Lamb, taking the animal into the back room, shut the door, opened the cat's mouth, and applied the poison. One moment later a wild, unearthly \"M-e-e-e-e-ow-ow-ow! \" was emitted by the cat, and, to Mr. Lamb's intense alarm, the animal began swishing around the room with hair on end and tail in convulsive excitement, screeching like a fog-whistle. Mr. Lamb is not certain, but he considers it a fair estimate to say that the cat made the entire circuit of the room, over chairs and under tables, seventy-four times every minute, and he is willing to swear to seventy times, without counting the occasional diversions made by the brute for the purpose of snatching at Mr. Lamb's pantaloons and hair. Just as Mr. Lamb had about made up his mind that the cat would conclude the gymnastic exercises by eating him, the animal dashed through the glass sash of the door into the shop, whisked two jars of licorice root and tooth-brushes off the counter, tore out the ipecac-bottle and four jugs of hair-dye, smashed a bottle of \" Balm of Peru,\" alighted on the bonnet of a woman who was drinking soda-water, and after a few convulsions rolled over into a soap-box and died. Mr. Lamb is now satisfied that a cat actually can be killed in the manner aforementioned, but he would be better satisfied if old Squills didn't insist upon collecting from him the price of those drugs and the glass sash. * * * * * Last summer Peter 's brother spent a few weeks with him. He owned a \"pistol cane,\" which he carried about with him loaded; but when he went away, he accidentally left it behind, and without explaining to Peter that it was different from ordinary canes. So, one afternoon a few days later, Peter went out to Keyser's farm to look at some stock, and he picked up the cane to take along with him. When he got to Keyser's, the latter went to the barnyard to show him an extraordinary kind of a new pig that he had developed by cross-breeding. \"Now that pig,\" said Keyser, \"just lays over all the other pigs on the Atlantic Slope. Take him any way you please, he's the most gorgeous pig anywheres around. Fat! Why, he's all fat! There 's no lean in him. He ain't anything but a solid mass of lard. Put that pig near a fire, and in twenty minutes his naked skeleton'd be standing there in a puddle of grease. That's a positive fact. Now, you just feel his shoulder. \" Then Peter lifted up his cane and gave the pig a poke. He poked it two or three times, and he had just remarked, \"That certainly is a splendid pig,\" when he gave it another poke, and then somehow the pistol in the cane went off and the pig rolled over and expired. [Illustration: HOW THE PIG WAS KILLED] \"What in the mischief d'you do that for? \" exclaimed Keyser, amazed and indignant. \"Do it for? _ I _ didn't do it! This cane must've been made out of an old gun-barrel with the load left in. I never had the least idea, I pledge _you _ my word , that there was anything the matter with it. \" \" That 's pretty thin,\" said Keyser; \"you had a grudge agin that pig because you couldn't scare up a pig like him, and you killed him on purpose. \" \" That 's perfectly ridiculous. \" \"Oh, maybe it is. You'll just fork over two hundred dollars for that piece of pork, if you please. \" \"I'll see you in Egypt first. \" * * * * * Peter whipped ; but if Keyser _did_ give in first, Peter went home with a bleeding nose, and the next day he was arrested for killing the pig. The case is coming up soon, and Peter's brother is on, ready to testify about that cane. Peter himself walks now with a hickory stick. CHAPTER XIV. _ RESPECTING CERTAIN SAVAGES _. When young Mr. Spooner, Judge Twiddler's nephew, left college, he made up his mind to enter the ministry and become a missionary. One day he met Captain Hubbs; and when he mentioned that he thought of going out as a missionary, Captain Hubbs asked him, \"Where are you going? \" _S_. \"To the Navigator Islands. I sail in October. \" _Capt_. (shaking his head mournfully). \"Pore young man! Pore young man! It is too bad--too bad indeed! Going to the Navigator Islands! Not married yet, I reckon? No? Ah! so much the better. No wife and children to make widows and orphans of. But it's sad, anyway. A promising young fellow like you! My heart bleeds for you. \" _S_. \"What d'you mean?\" _Capt_. \"Oh, nothing. I don't want to frighten you. I know you're doing it from a sense of duty. But I've been there to the Navigator Islands, and I'm acquainted with the people's little ways, and I--well, I--I--the fact is, you see, that--well, sooner'n disguise the truth, I don't mind telling you straight out that the last day I was there the folks et one of my legs--sawed it off an' et it. Now you can see how things are yourself. Those Navigators gobbled that leg right up. It was a leg a good deal like yours, only heavier, I reckon. \" _S_. \"You astonish me! \" _Capt. _ \"Oh, that's nothing. They did that just for a little bit of fun. The chief told me the day before that they never et anything but human beings. He said his family consumed about three a day all the year round, counting holidays and Sundays. He was a light eater himself, he said, on account of gitting dyspepsia from a tough Australian that he et in 1847, but the girls and the old woman, so he said, were very hearty eaters, and it kept him busy prowling around after human beings to satisfy 'em. The old woman, he said, rather preferred to eat babies, on account of her teeth being poor, but the girls could eat the grizzliest sailor that ever went aboard ship. \" _S_. \" This is frightful. \" _Capt_. \" And the chief said sometimes the supply was scarce, but lately they had begun to depend more on imported goods than on the home products. And they were better, anyhow, for all the folks preferred white meat. He said the missionary societies were shipping them some nice lots of provender, and the tears came in his eyes when he said how good they were to the poor friendless savage away on a distant island. He said he liked a missionary not too old or too young. But let's see; what's your age, did you say? \" [Illustration: MR. SPOONER IS ALARMED] _S_. \"I am twenty-eight. \" _Capt. _ \" I think he mentioned twenty-seven; but howsomedever, he liked 'em old enough to be solid and young enough to be tender. And he said he liked missionaries because they never used rum or tobacco and always kept their flavor. I know I seen one young fellow who came out there from Boston . He got up a camp-meeting in the woods; and while he was giving out the hymn, one of the congregation banged him on the head with a club, and in less than no time he was sizzling over a fire right in front of the pulpit. They lit the fire with his hymn-book and kept her going with his sermons. He was a man just about your build--a little leaner'n you, maybe. And they like a man to be stoutish. He eats more tender. \" _S_. \" I had no idea that such awful practices existed. \" _Capt_. \" I haven't",

I want to know who was the mother-in-law of Moses. \" \" Oh yes; certainly. Excuse me; I thought you were inquiring about roses. The law of Moses was the foundation of the religion of the Jews. You can find it in full in the Pentateuch. It is admirable--very admirable--for the purpose for which it was ordained. We, of course, have outlived that dispensation, but it still contains many things that are useful to us, as, for instance, the--\" \"Was Moses married? \" shrieked Mr. Lamb. \"Married? Oh, yes; the name of his father-in-law, you know, was Jethro, and--\" \"Who was his wife? \" \"Why, she was the daughter of Jethro, of course. I said Jethro was his father-in-law. \" \" No; Jethro's wife, I mean. I want to know to settle a bet. \" \" No, that wasn't her name. 'Bet' is a corruption of Elizabeth, and that name, I believe, is not found in the Old Testament. I don't remember what the name of Moses' wife was. \" \" I want to know what was the name of the mother-in-law of Moses , to settle a bet. \" \"Young man,\" said the old doctor, sternly, \"you are trifling with a serious subject. What do you mean by wanting Moses to settle a bet? \" Then Mr. Lamb rolled up a sheet of music that lay on the piano; and putting it to the doctor's ear, he shouted, \"I made--a--bet--that--I--could--find--out--what--the--name--ofMoses'--mother-in-law--was. Can--you--tell--me? \" \" The Bible don't say,\" responded the doctor; \"and unless you can get a spiritualist to put you in communication with Moses, I guess you will lose. \" Then Peter went around and handed over the stakes. Hereafter he will gamble on other than biblical games. * * * * * [Illustration: THE CAT SUCCUMBS] Mr. Lamb has an inquiring mind. He is always investigating something. He read somewhere the other day that two drops of the essential oil of tobacco placed upon the tongue of a cat would kill the animal instantly. He did not believe it, and he concluded to try the experiment to see if it was so. Old Squills, the druggist, has a cat weighing about fifteen pounds, and Mr. Lamb, taking the animal into the back room, shut the door, opened the cat's mouth, and applied the poison. One moment later a wild, unearthly \"M-e-e-e-e-ow-ow-ow! \" was emitted by the cat, and, to Mr. Lamb's intense alarm, the animal began swishing around the room with hair on end and tail in convulsive excitement, screeching like a fog-whistle. Mr. Lamb is not certain, but he considers it a fair estimate to say that the cat made the entire circuit of the room, over chairs and under tables, seventy-four times every minute, and he is willing to swear to seventy times, without counting the occasional diversions made by the brute for the purpose of snatching at Mr. Lamb's pantaloons and hair. Just as Mr. Lamb had about made up his mind that the cat would conclude the gymnastic exercises by eating him, the animal dashed through the glass sash of the door into the shop, whisked two jars of licorice root and tooth-brushes off the counter, tore out the ipecac-bottle and four jugs of hair-dye, smashed a bottle of \" Balm of Peru,\" alighted on the bonnet of a woman who was drinking soda-water, and after a few convulsions rolled over into a soap-box and died. Mr. Lamb is now satisfied that a cat actually can be killed in the manner aforementioned, but he would be better satisfied if old Squills didn't insist upon collecting from him the price of those drugs and the glass sash. * * * * * Last summer Peter 's brother spent a few weeks with him. He owned a \"pistol cane,\" which he carried about with him loaded; but when he went away, he accidentally left it behind, and without explaining to Peter that it was different from ordinary canes. So, one afternoon a few days later, Peter went out to Keyser's farm to look at some stock, and he picked up the cane to take along with him. When he got to Keyser's, the latter went to the barnyard to show him an extraordinary kind of a new pig that he had developed by cross-breeding. \"Now that pig,\" said Keyser, \"just lays over all the other pigs on the Atlantic Slope. Take him any way you please, he's the most gorgeous pig anywheres around. Fat! Why, he's all fat! There 's no lean in him. He ain't anything but a solid mass of lard. Put that pig near a fire, and in twenty minutes his naked skeleton'd be standing there in a puddle of grease. That's a positive fact. Now, you just feel his shoulder. \" Then Peter lifted up his cane and gave the pig a poke. He poked it two or three times, and he had just remarked, \"That certainly is a splendid pig,\" when he gave it another poke, and then somehow the pistol in the cane went off and the pig rolled over and expired. [Illustration: HOW THE PIG WAS KILLED] \"What in the mischief d'you do that for? \" exclaimed Keyser, amazed and indignant. \"Do it for? _ I _ didn't do it! This cane must've been made out of an old gun-barrel with the load left in. I never had the least idea, I pledge _you _ my word , that there was anything the matter with it. \" \" That 's pretty thin,\" said Keyser; \"you had a grudge agin that pig because you couldn't scare up a pig like him, and you killed him on purpose. \" \" That 's perfectly ridiculous. \" \"Oh, maybe it is. You'll just fork over two hundred dollars for that piece of pork, if you please. \" \"I'll see you in Egypt first. \" * * * * * Peter whipped ; but if Keyser _did_ give in first, Peter went home with a bleeding nose, and the next day he was arrested for killing the pig. The case is coming up soon, and Peter's brother is on, ready to testify about that cane. Peter himself walks now with a hickory stick. CHAPTER XIV. _ RESPECTING CERTAIN SAVAGES _. When young Mr. Spooner, Judge Twiddler's nephew, left college, he made up his mind to enter the ministry and become a missionary. One day he met Captain Hubbs; and when he mentioned that he thought of going out as a missionary, Captain Hubbs asked him, \"Where are you going? \" _S_. \"To the Navigator Islands. I sail in October. \" _Capt_. (shaking his head mournfully). \"Pore young man! Pore young man! It is too bad--too bad indeed! Going to the Navigator Islands! Not married yet, I reckon? No? Ah! so much the better. No wife and children to make widows and orphans of. But it's sad, anyway. A promising young fellow like you! My heart bleeds for you. \" _S_. \"What d'you mean?\" _Capt_. \"Oh, nothing. I don't want to frighten you. I know you're doing it from a sense of duty. But I've been there to the Navigator Islands, and I'm acquainted with the people's little ways, and I--well, I--I--the fact is, you see, that--well, sooner'n disguise the truth, I don't mind telling you straight out that the last day I was there the folks et one of my legs--sawed it off an' et it. Now you can see how things are yourself. Those Navigators gobbled that leg right up. It was a leg a good deal like yours, only heavier, I reckon. \" _S_. \"You astonish me! \" _Capt. _ \"Oh, that's nothing. They did that just for a little bit of fun. The chief told me the day before that they never et anything but human beings. He said his family consumed about three a day all the year round, counting holidays and Sundays. He was a light eater himself, he said, on account of gitting dyspepsia from a tough Australian that he et in 1847, but the girls and the old woman, so he said, were very hearty eaters, and it kept him busy prowling around after human beings to satisfy 'em. The old woman, he said, rather preferred to eat babies, on account of her teeth being poor, but the girls could eat the grizzliest sailor that ever went aboard ship. \" _S_. \" This is frightful. \" _Capt_. \" And the chief said sometimes the supply was scarce, but lately they had begun to depend more on imported goods than on the home products. And they were better, anyhow, for all the folks preferred white meat. He said the missionary societies were shipping them some nice lots of provender, and the tears came in his eyes when he said how good they were to the poor friendless savage away on a distant island. He said he liked a missionary not too old or too young. But let's see; what's your age, did you say? \" [Illustration: MR. SPOONER IS ALARMED] _S_. \"I am twenty-eight. \" _Capt. _ \" I think he mentioned twenty-seven; but howsomedever, he liked 'em old enough to be solid and young enough to be tender. And he said he liked missionaries because they never used rum or tobacco and always kept their flavor. I know I seen one young fellow who came out there from Boston . He got up a camp-meeting in the woods; and while he was giving out the hymn, one of the congregation banged him on the head with a club, and in less than no time he was sizzling over a fire right in front of the pulpit. They lit the fire with his hymn-book and kept her going with his sermons. He was a man just about your build--a little leaner'n you, maybe. And they like a man to be stoutish. He eats more tender. \" _S_. \" I had no idea that such awful practices existed. \" _Capt_. \" I haven't",

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion.",

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion.",

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion.",

To depict events that are simply amusing may not be the highest and best function of a writer; but if he has a strong impulse to undertake such a task in the intervals of more serious work, it may be that he performs a duty which is more obvious because the common inclination of those who tell the story of human life is to present that which is sad and terrible, and to lead-the reader, whose soul has bitterness enough of its own, into contemplation of the true or fictitious anguish of others.",

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion. If it is filled with nonsense, that nonsense at any rate is innocent. It is modest, cleanly and without malice or irreverence. A worthier and nobler work might have been written; a purer work could not have been. What its other merits are he who reads it will discern. To apologize for it in any manner would be to admit that it has grave deficiencies, and such an admission the author would not make even if his conscience impelled him to do so. The book is offered to the reader with the conviction that if the man who laughs is the happiest man, it may contribute something to the sum of human felicity. The story of the French horn, related in the twentieth chapter, will recall to the reader of the \"Sparrowgrass Papers\" an incident related in that most charming book of humor. Perhaps it ought to be said that the former narrative was at least suggested by the latter. The artist who has illustrated the book, Mr. Arthur B. Frost, deserves to have it said of him that he has done his work skilfully, tastefully and with nice appreciation of the humor of the various situations. CONTENTS CHAPTER I.

BALLAST MAJOR SLOTT 'S TIGER FACING THE TIGER CHAPTER I. PROLOGUE. _THE ADVANTAGES OF ELBOW-ROOM_. The professors of sociology, in exploring the mysteries of the science of human living, have not agreed that elbow-room is one of the great needs of modern civilized society, but this may be because they have not yet reached the bottom of things and discovered the truth. In crowded communities men have chances of development in certain directions, but in others their growth is surely checked. A man who lives in a large city is apt to experience a sharpening of his wits, for attrition of minds as well as of pebbles produces polish and brilliancy; but perhaps this very process prevents the free unfolding of parts of his character. If his individuality is not partially lost amid the crowd, it is likely that, first, his imitative faculty will induce him to shape himself in accordance with another than his own pattern, and that, second, the dread of the conspicuousness which is the certain result of eccentricity will persuade him to avoid any tendency he may have to become strongly unlike his neighbors. The house that he lives in is tightly squeezed in a row of dwellings builded upon a precisely similar plan, so that the influence brought to bear upon him by the home resembles to some extent that which operates upon his fellows. There is a pressure upon both sides of him in the house; and when he plunges into business, there is a far greater pressure there, in the shape of sharp competition, which brings him into constant collision with other men, and mayhap drives him or compels him to drive his weaker rival to the wall. The city-man is likely to cover himself with a mantle of reserve and dissimulation. If he has a longing to wander in untrodden and devious paths, he is disposed resolutely to suppress his desire and to go in the beaten track. If Smith, in a savage state, would certainly conduct himself in a wholly original manner, in a social condition he yields to an inevitable apprehension that Jones will think queer of his behavior, and he shapes his actions in accordance with the plan that Jones, with strong impulses to unusual and individual conduct, has adopted because he is afraid he will be thought singular by Smith. And in the mean time, Robinson, burning with a desire to go wantonly in a direction wholly diverse from that of his associates, realizes that to set at defiance the theories of which Smith and Jones are apparently the earnest advocates would be to expose himself to harsh criticism, sacrifices himself to his terror of their opinion and yields to the force of their example. In smaller and less densely-populated communities the weight of public opinion is not largely decreased, but the pressure is not so great. There is more elbow-room. A man who knows everybody about him gauges with a reasonable degree of accuracy the characters of those who are to judge him, and is able to form a pretty fair estimate of the value of their opinions. When men can do this, they are apt to feel a greater degree of freedom in following their natural impulses. If men could sound the depths of all knowledge and read with ease the secrets of the universe, they might lose much of their reverence. When they know the exact worth of the judgment of their fellow-men, they begin to regard it with comparative indifference. And so, if a dweller in a small village desires to leave the beaten track, he can summon courage to do so with greater readiness than the man of the town . If he has occasionally that proneness to make a fool of himself which seizes every man now and then, he may indulge in the perilous luxury without great carefulness of the consequences",

If he couldn't get Bibles, he'd take Testaments; but unless he got Scriptures of some kind, he was utterly intractable. \" \" I would like to have had a look at that horse, sweet. \" \" So we got the horse-doctor again, and he said that what the poor animal wanted was a hypodermic injection of morphia to calm his nerves. He told Patrick to get a machine for placing the morphia under the horse 's skin. But Patrick said that he could do it without the machine. So one day he got the morphia, and began to bore a hole in the horse with a gimlet. \" \" A gimlet, Emma? \" \" An ordinary gimlet. But it seemed unpleasant to the horse, and so he kicked Patrick through the partition, breaking three of his ribs. Then I got the doctor to perform the operation properly, and the horse after that appeared right well, excepting that Patrick said that he had suddenly acquired an extraordinary propensity for standing on his head. \" \" He is the first horse that ever wanted to do that, love. \" \" Patrick said not. He told me about a man he worked for in Oshkosh who had a team of mules which always stood on their heads when they were not at work . He said all the mules in Oshkosh did. So Patrick tied a heavy stone to our horse's tail to Balance him and keep him straight. And this worked to a charm until I took the horse to church one Sunday, when, while a crowd stood round him looking at him, he swung his tail around and brained six boys with the stone. \" \"Brained them, love? \" \"Well, I didn't see them myself, but Patrick told me, when I came out of church, that they were as good as dead. And he said he remembered that that Oshkosh man used to coax his mules to stand on their legs by letting them hear music. It soothed them, he said. And so Patrick got a friend to come around and sit in the stall and calm our horse by playing on the accordion . \" \" Did it make him calmer? \" \" It seemed to at first; but one day Patrick undertook to bleed him for the blind staggers, and he must have cut the horse in the wrong place, for the poor brute fell over on the accordion person and died, nearly killing the musician. \" \" The horse is dead, then? Where is the bill? \" \"I'll read it to you: THE BILL. Horse-doctor's fees $125 50 Paregoric for cough 80 00 Galvanic battery 10 00 Repairing stable 12 25 Potts' cow, pigs, apple trees and baby 251 00 Damage to door-knobs, etc. 175 00 Louisa 's hymn-book 25 Gimlet and injections 15 00 Repairing Patrick",

        "excerpt": "ever saw. \" And about his having glanders and botts and blind staggers and a raw shoulder, I can tell you that those things never attack any but a thoroughbred horse; and for my part, I made up my mind years ago, when I was a child, that if any man ever offered me a horse that hadn't blind staggers I wouldn't take him as a gift . Now, that 's as true as you're alive . Professor Owen says that so far from regarding glanders as a disease he considers it the crowning glory of a good horse, and he wants the English government to pass a law inoculating every horse on the island with it. You write to him and ask him if that ain't so. \" And so Butterwick put his phenomenal horse in his stable, hired an Irishman to take care of it, and possessed his soul in peace. However, before he fairly had a chance to enjoy his purchase, he was summoned to St. Louis to look after some business matters, and he was detained there for about six weeks. During his absence Mrs. Butterwick assumed the responsibility for the management of the horse; and as she knew as much about taking care of horses as she did about conducting the processes of the sidereal system, the result was that Mr. Butterwick's horse was the unconscious parent of infinite disaster. When Butterwick returned and had kissed his wife and talked over his journey, the following conversation ensued. Mrs. Butterwick said, \"You know our horse, dearest? \" \"Yes, sweet; how is he getting along? \" \" Not so _very _ well; he has cost a great deal of money since you've been away. \" \"Indeed? \" \"Yes; besides his regular feed and Patrick 's wages as hostler, I have on hand unpaid bills to the amount of two thousand dollars on his account. \" \" Two thousand! Why, Emma, you amaze me! What on earth does it mean? \" \" I'll tell you the whole story, love . Just after you left he took a severe cold, and he coughed incessantly. You could hear him cough for miles. All the neighbors complained of it, and Mr. Potts, next door, was so mad that he shot at the horse four times. Patrick said it was whooping-cough. \" \" Whooping-cough, darling! Impossible! A horse _never_ has whooping-cough. \" \"Well, Patrick said so. And as I always give paregoric to the children when they cough, I concluded that it would be good for the horse, so I bought a bucketful and gave it to him with sugar. \" \" A bucketful of paregoric, my love! It was enough to kill him. \" \" Patrick said that was a regular dose for a horse of sedentary habits ; and it didn't kill him: it put him to sleep. You will be surprised, dear, to learn that the horse slept straight ahead for four weeks. Never woke up once. I was frightened about it , but Patrick told me that it was a sign of a good horse. He said that Dexter often slept six months on a stretch, and that once they took Goldsmith Maid to a race while she was sound asleep and she trotted a mile in 2:15, I think he said, without getting awake. \" \" Patrick said that, did he? \" \"Yes; that was at the end of the second week. But as the horse didn't rouse up, Patrick said it couldn't be the paregoric that kept him asleep so long; and he came to me and asked me not to mention it, but he had suspicions that Mr. Fogg had mesmerized him. \" \" I never heard of a horse being mesmerized, dearest. \" \" Neither did I, but Patrick said it was a common thing with the better class of horses. And when he kept on sleeping, dear, I got frightened, and Patrick consulted the horse-doctor, who came over with a galvanic battery, which he said would wake the horse. They fixed the wires to his leg and turned on the current. It did rouse him. He got up and kicked fourteen boards out of the side of the stable and then jumped the fence into Mr. Potts' yard, where he trod on a litter of young pigs, kicked two cows to death and bit the tops off of eight apple trees. Patrick said he tried to swallow Mrs. Potts' baby, but I didn't see him do that. Patrick may have exaggerated. I don't know. It seems hardly likely, does it, that the horse would actually try to eat a child? \" \" The man that sold him to me didn't mention that he was fond of babies. \" \" But he got over the attack. The only effect was that the paregoric or the electricity, or something, turned his hair all the wrong way, and he looks the queerest you ever saw. Oh yes; it did seem to affect his appetite, too. He appeared to be always hungry.",

It appears that while the general was on his way home Mrs. Bing moved into another house; and when the general returned with the sad intelligence, he did not know of the fact, but went to the old house, which was now occupied by Mrs. Wood. He told the servant-girl to tell her mistress to come into the parlor, and then he took a seat on the sofa and thought how he could break the news of the major's death to her so as not to give her too violent a shock. When Mrs. Wood entered, the general greeted her mournfully; and when they had taken seats, the following conversation ensued: \"Madam, I have been the major's friend ever since our childhood. I played with him when we were boys together. I grew up to manhood with him; I watched with pride his noble and successful career; I rejoiced when he married the lovely woman before me; and I went to the West with him. Need I tell you that I loved him? I loved him only less than you did. \" \" I don't understand you, sir,\" said Mrs. Wood. \"Whom are you referring to?\" \"Why, to the major. I say that your love for him alone was greater than mine; and I am--\" \" Your remarks are a mystery to me. I have no attachment of that kind. \" \" Call it what you will, madam . I know how strong the tie was between you--how deep the devotion which kept two loving souls in perfect unison. And knowing this, of course I feel deeply that to wound either heart by telling of misfortune to the other is a task from which a man like me might very properly shrink. But I have a duty to perform--a solemn duty. What would you say, my dear madam, if I should tell you that the major had lost a leg? What would you say to that? \" \" I don't know. If I knew a major who had lost a leg, I should probably advise him to buy a wooden one. \" \" Light-hearted as ever,\" said the general. \"Just as he told me you were. Poor woman! you will need your buoyant spirits yet. But, dear madam, suppose the major had lost not only one leg, but two; both gone; no legs at all; not a pin to stand on; now, how would that strike you? \" \"Really, sir, this is getting to be absurd. I don't care whether your major has as many legs as a centipede or none at all. If you have any business with me, please transact it as quickly as possible. \" \"Madam, this is too serious a subject for jest The major has lost not only his legs, but his arms. He is absolutely without limbs of any kind at this moment. That's as true as I'm sitting here. Now, don't scream, please. \" \"I haven't the slightest idea of screaming. \" \"Well, you take it mighty cool, I must say. But that's not the worst of it. All his ribs are gone, his nose has departed, and he only has one eye and a part of one shoulder-blade. I pledge you my word that 's the truth. I hardly think he will recover. \" \" I shouldn't think he would, in that condition; but, upon my life, I cannot see that the fact interests me at all. \" \" Not interest you! Well, that is amazing! Not int--Why, my goodness, woman, that's not half of it. The major's scalp's all gone; he hasn't enough fuzz on his head to make a camel's-hair pencil; he has a stake through his body, and he's been burnt until he is all doubled up in a hard knot; and, in my private opinion, it's mighty unlikely he'll ever be untied and straightened out again. If that doesn't fetch you, you must have a heart of stone. \" \" I don't care anything about it, sir. It's none of my business. \" \"Well, then, as long as you're so indifferent, let me tell you, plump and plain, that the major's dead as Julius Caesar! The Indians killed him, burnt him and minced him up! Now, that's the solemn truth, and his last words to me were, 'Break the news gently to Maria. ' You see the man loved you. He cared more for you than you seemed to do for him. He would have welcomed death if he had known you had ceased to love him. \" \" What did you say his last words were? \" \"Why, just before his soul took its eternal flight he whispered something in my ear. Then I made a sudden dash and escaped from the savages, to bring his message back to you. That message was: 'Break the news gently to Maria. ' That's what the major said with his dying lips. \" \"Well, then, why don't you break the news to Maria? \" \"Madam, such levity is untimely. I have broken it--broken it gently. You have heard it all. \" \" Do you suppose I am Major Bing 's wife? \" \"Certainly.",

ELBOW-ROOM _ A NOVEL WITHOUT A PLOT_ BY MAX ADELER 1870 AUTHOR OF \"OUT OF THE HURLY-BURLY,\" ETC. , ETC. ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR B. FROST [Illustration: Frontispiece] PREFACE If every book that contains nothing but nonsense confessed that fact in its preface, the world would have been saved a vast amount of dreary reading. Most of such volumes, however, are believed by their authors to be full of wisdom of the solidest kind; and confession, therefore, being impossible, the reader may learn the truth only through much tribulation. The writer of this book freely admits, at the outset, that it contains only the lightest humor, and that its single purpose is to afford amusement . At the same time, he claims for it that it is wiser and far more useful than many more solemn books that have been published, with the intent to regenerate mankind, by authors who would regard such a volume as this with feelings of scorn. This is simply an effort to tell stories of a humorous character; and although the attempt may not be so successful as it has been in the hands of others, from Boccaccio downward, it has at least one quality that some greater achievements do not possess: it is absolutely pure in thought, word and suggestion.",

He got measured for a burial-suit, he drew up his will, he picked out a nice lot in the cemetery and had it fenced in, he joined the church and selected six of the deacons as his pall-bearers; he also requested the choir to sing at the funeral, and he got them to run over a favorite hymn of his to see how it would sound. Then he got Toombs, the undertaker, to knock together a burial-casket with silver-plated handles, and cushions inside, and he instructed the undertaker to use his best hearse, and to buy sixty pairs of black gloves, to be distributed among the mourners. He had some trouble deciding upon a tombstone. The man at the marble-yard, however, at last sold him a beautiful one with an angel weeping over a kind of a flower-pot, with the legend, \" Not lost, but gone before. \" Then he got the village newspaper to put a good obituary notice of him in type, and he told his wife that he would be gratified if she would come out in the spring and plant violets upon his grave. He said it was hard to leave her and the children, but she must try and bear up under it. These afflictions are for our good, and when he was an angel he would come and watch over her and keep his eye on her . He said she might marry again if she wanted to; for although the mere thought of it nearly broke his heart, he wished her, above all, to be happy, and to have some one to love her and protect her from the storms of the rude world. Then he and Mrs. Keyser and the children cried, and Keyser, as a closing word of counsel, advised her not to plough for corn earlier than the middle of March . On the night of the 13th of September there was a flood in the creek, and Keyser got up at four o'clock in the morning of the 14th and worked until night, trying to save his buildings and his woodpile.",

He got measured for a burial-suit, he drew up his will, he picked out a nice lot in the cemetery and had it fenced in, he joined the church and selected six of the deacons as his pall-bearers; he also requested the choir to sing at the funeral, and he got them to run over a favorite hymn of his to see how it would sound. Then he got Toombs, the undertaker, to knock together a burial-casket with silver-plated handles, and cushions inside, and he instructed the undertaker to use his best hearse, and to buy sixty pairs of black gloves, to be distributed among the mourners. He had some trouble deciding upon a tombstone. The man at the marble-yard, however, at last sold him a beautiful one with an angel weeping over a kind of a flower-pot, with the legend, \" Not lost, but gone before. \" Then he got the village newspaper to put a good obituary notice of him in type, and he told his wife that he would be gratified if she would come out in the spring and plant violets upon his grave. He said it was hard to leave her and the children, but she must try and bear up under it. These afflictions are for our good, and when he was an angel he would come and watch over her and keep his eye on her . He said she might marry again if she wanted to; for although the mere thought of it nearly broke his heart, he wished her, above all, to be happy, and to have some one to love her and protect her from the storms of the rude world. Then he and Mrs. Keyser and the children cried, and Keyser, as a closing word of counsel, advised her not to plough for corn earlier than the middle of March . On the night of the 13th of September there was a flood in the creek, and Keyser got up at four o'clock in the morning of the 14th and worked until night, trying to save his buildings and his woodpile.",

        "excerpt": "the flower-pot tombstone and a shovel, and stepped in to ask the widow how deep she wanted the grave dug. Just then the choir arrived with the minister, and the company was assembled in the parlor, when Keyser came in from the stable, where he had been dosing a horse with patent medicine and warm \"mash\" for the glanders. He was surprised, but he proceeded to explain that there had been a little mistake, somehow. He was also pained to find that everybody seemed to be a good deal disappointed, particularly the tombstone-man, who went away mad, declaring that such an old fraud ought to be buried, anyhow, dead or alive. Just as the deacons left in a huff the tailor's boy arrived with the burial-suit, and before Keyser could kick him off the steps the paper-carrier flung into the door the _Patriot_, in which that obituary notice occupied a prominent place. Anybody who wants a good reliable tombstone that has a flower-pot and an angel on it, with an affecting inscription, can buy one of that kind, at a sacrifice for cash, from Keyser. He thinks the bad dream must have been caused by eating too much at supper. After he felt assured that he should have to remain a little longer in this troublous world, Mr. Keyser determined to effect some improvements of his farm that he had thought of. He greatly needed a constant supply of water, and he resolved to bore an artesian well in the barn-yard. The boring was done with a two-inch auger fixed in the end of an iron rod, which was twisted around by a wheel worked by two men. One day, after they had gone down a good many feet, they tried to pull the rod out, but it would not come. They were afraid to use much force lest the auger should come off and stay in the hole , and so, as the boring went along well enough, they concluded to keep on turning, and to trust to the force of the water, when they struck it, to drive the loose dirt up from the hole . When they had gone down about three hundred and fifty feet, they began to think it queer that there were no signs of water, but they bored a hundred feet farther; and one day, just as they were beginning on another hundred, something odd happened. On the day in question Keyser 's boy came running into the house and told him to come into the garden quick, for there was some kind of an extraordinary animal with a sharp nose burrowing out of the ground. Keyser concluded that it must be either a potato-bug or a grasshopper that had been hatched in the spring, and he took out a bottle of poison to drop on it when it came up. When Keyser reached the spot, a couple of hundred yards from where they were boring the well, there certainly was some kind of a creature slowly pushing its way up through the sod. Its nose seemed to resemble a sharp point like steel. Keyser dropped some poison on it; but it didn't appear to mind the stuff, but kept slowly creeping up from the ground. Then Keyser felt it, and was astonished to find that it felt exactly like the end of a fork-prong. He sent the boy over to call Perkins and the rest of the neighbors. Pretty soon a large crowd collected, and by this time the animal had emerged to the extent of a couple of inches. [Illustration: A QUEER PLANT] Everybody was amazed to see that it looked exactly like the end of a large auger; and two or three timid men were so scared at the idea of such a thing actually growing out of the earth that they suddenly got over the fence and left. Perkins couldn't account for it; but he suggested that maybe somebody might have planted a gimlet there, and it had taken root and blossomed out into an auger; but he admitted that he had never heard of such a thing before. The excitement increased so that the men who were boring the artesian well knocked off and came over to see the phenomenon. It was noticed that as soon as they stopped work the auger ceased to grow; and when they arrived, they looked at it for a minute, and one of them said, \"Bill, do you recognize that auger? \" \" I think I do ,\" said Bill. \"Well, Bill, you go and unhitch that wheel from the other end of the rod. \" Bill did so; and then the other man asked the crowd to take hold of the auger and pull. They did; and out came four hundred and fifty feet of iron rod. The auger had slid off to the side, turned upward and come to the surface in Keyser 's garden. Then the artesian well was abandoned, and Keyser bought a steam-pump and began to get water from the river. Another remarkable boring experience that occurred in our neighborhood deserves to be related here. When Butterwick bought his present place, the former owner offered, as one of the inducements to purchase, the fact that there was a superb sugar-maple tree in the garden. It was a noble tree, and Butterwick made up his mind that he would tap it some day and manufacture some sugar. However, he never did so until last year. Then he concluded to draw the sap and to have \"a sugar-boiling. \" Mr. Butterwick 's wife's uncle was staying with him, and after inviting some friends to come and eat the sugar they got to work. They took a huge wash-kettle down into the yard and piled some wood beneath it, and then they brought out a couple of buckets to catch the sap, and the auger with which to bore a hole in the tree . Butterwick's wife's uncle said that the bucket ought to be set about three feet from the tree, as the sap would spurt right out with a good deal of force, and it would be a pity to waste any of it. Then he lighted the fire, while Butterwick bored the hole about four inches deep. When he took the auger out, the sap did not follow, but Butterwick's wife's uncle said what it wanted was a little time, and so, while the folks waited, he put a fresh armful of wood on the fire. They waited half an hour; and as the sap didn't come, Butterwick concluded that the hole was not deep enough, so he began boring again, but he bored too far, for the auger went clear through the tree and penetrated the back of his wife's uncle, who was leaning up against the trunk trying to light his pipe. He jumped nearly forty feet, and they had to mend him up with court-plaster. [Illustration: TOO MUCH OF A BORE. ] Then he said he thought the reason the sap didn't come was that there ought to be a kind of spigot in the hole, so as to let it run off easily. They got the wooden spigot from the vinegar-barrel in the cellar and inserted it. Then, as the sap did not come, Butterwick's wife's uncle said he thought the spigot must be jammed in so tight that it choked the flow ; and while Butterwick tried to push it out, his wife's uncle fed the fire with some kindling-wood. As the spigot could not be budged with a hammer, Butterwick concluded to bore it out with the auger;",

        "excerpt": "the flower-pot tombstone and a shovel, and stepped in to ask the widow how deep she wanted the grave dug. Just then the choir arrived with the minister, and the company was assembled in the parlor, when Keyser came in from the stable, where he had been dosing a horse with patent medicine and warm \"mash\" for the glanders. He was surprised, but he proceeded to explain that there had been a little mistake, somehow. He was also pained to find that everybody seemed to be a good deal disappointed, particularly the tombstone-man, who went away mad, declaring that such an old fraud ought to be buried, anyhow, dead or alive. Just as the deacons left in a huff the tailor's boy arrived with the burial-suit, and before Keyser could kick him off the steps the paper-carrier flung into the door the _Patriot_, in which that obituary notice occupied a prominent place. Anybody who wants a good reliable tombstone that has a flower-pot and an angel on it, with an affecting inscription, can buy one of that kind, at a sacrifice for cash, from Keyser. He thinks the bad dream must have been caused by eating too much at supper. After he felt assured that he should have to remain a little longer in this troublous world, Mr. Keyser determined to effect some improvements of his farm that he had thought of. He greatly needed a constant supply of water, and he resolved to bore an artesian well in the barn-yard. The boring was done with a two-inch auger fixed in the end of an iron rod, which was twisted around by a wheel worked by two men. One day, after they had gone down a good many feet, they tried to pull the rod out, but it would not come. They were afraid to use much force lest the auger should come off and stay in the hole , and so, as the boring went along well enough, they concluded to keep on turning, and to trust to the force of the water, when they struck it, to drive the loose dirt up from the hole . When they had gone down about three hundred and fifty feet, they began to think it queer that there were no signs of water, but they bored a hundred feet farther; and one day, just as they were beginning on another hundred, something odd happened. On the day in question Keyser 's boy came running into the house and told him to come into the garden quick, for there was some kind of an extraordinary animal with a sharp nose burrowing out of the ground. Keyser concluded that it must be either a potato-bug or a grasshopper that had been hatched in the spring, and he took out a bottle of poison to drop on it when it came up. When Keyser reached the spot, a couple of hundred yards from where they were boring the well, there certainly was some kind of a creature slowly pushing its way up through the sod. Its nose seemed to resemble a sharp point like steel. Keyser dropped some poison on it; but it didn't appear to mind the stuff, but kept slowly creeping up from the ground. Then Keyser felt it, and was astonished to find that it felt exactly like the end of a fork-prong. He sent the boy over to call Perkins and the rest of the neighbors. Pretty soon a large crowd collected, and by this time the animal had emerged to the extent of a couple of inches. [Illustration: A QUEER PLANT] Everybody was amazed to see that it looked exactly like the end of a large auger; and two or three timid men were so scared at the idea of such a thing actually growing out of the earth that they suddenly got over the fence and left. Perkins couldn't account for it; but he suggested that maybe somebody might have planted a gimlet there, and it had taken root and blossomed out into an auger; but he admitted that he had never heard of such a thing before. The excitement increased so that the men who were boring the artesian well knocked off and came over to see the phenomenon. It was noticed that as soon as they stopped work the auger ceased to grow; and when they arrived, they looked at it for a minute, and one of them said, \"Bill, do you recognize that auger? \" \" I think I do ,\" said Bill. \"Well, Bill, you go and unhitch that wheel from the other end of the rod. \" Bill did so; and then the other man asked the crowd to take hold of the auger and pull. They did; and out came four hundred and fifty feet of iron rod. The auger had slid off to the side, turned upward and come to the surface in Keyser 's garden. Then the artesian well was abandoned, and Keyser bought a steam-pump and began to get water from the river. Another remarkable boring experience that occurred in our neighborhood deserves to be related here. When Butterwick bought his present place, the former owner offered, as one of the inducements to purchase, the fact that there was a superb sugar-maple tree in the garden. It was a noble tree, and Butterwick made up his mind that he would tap it some day and manufacture some sugar. However, he never did so until last year. Then he concluded to draw the sap and to have \"a sugar-boiling. \" Mr. Butterwick 's wife's uncle was staying with him, and after inviting some friends to come and eat the sugar they got to work. They took a huge wash-kettle down into the yard and piled some wood beneath it, and then they brought out a couple of buckets to catch the sap, and the auger with which to bore a hole in the tree . Butterwick's wife's uncle said that the bucket ought to be set about three feet from the tree, as the sap would spurt right out with a good deal of force, and it would be a pity to waste any of it. Then he lighted the fire, while Butterwick bored the hole about four inches deep. When he took the auger out, the sap did not follow, but Butterwick's wife's uncle said what it wanted was a little time, and so, while the folks waited, he put a fresh armful of wood on the fire. They waited half an hour; and as the sap didn't come, Butterwick concluded that the hole was not deep enough, so he began boring again, but he bored too far, for the auger went clear through the tree and penetrated the back of his wife's uncle, who was leaning up against the trunk trying to light his pipe. He jumped nearly forty feet, and they had to mend him up with court-plaster. [Illustration: TOO MUCH OF A BORE. ] Then he said he thought the reason the sap didn't come was that there ought to be a kind of spigot in the hole, so as to let it run off easily. They got the wooden spigot from the vinegar-barrel in the cellar and inserted it. Then, as the sap did not come, Butterwick's wife's uncle said he thought the spigot must be jammed in so tight that it choked the flow ; and while Butterwick tried to push it out, his wife's uncle fed the fire with some kindling-wood. As the spigot could not be budged with a hammer, Butterwick concluded to bore it out with the auger;",

We give a written guarantee with each rod. Never had a house struck since we began to offer this rod to the public. Positive fact.

It hadn't an ounce of platinum within a mile of it. The man that sold it ought to be prosecuted, and the fellow that put it up without insulators should be shot.
