        "excerpt": "them, and, when children are afoot, surge and riot there. In them do the common occupations of life find niche and channel . While bright weather holds, we wash out of doors on a Monday morning, the wash-bench in the solid block of shadow thrown by the house. We churn there, also, at the hour when Sweet-Breath, the cow, goes afield, modestly unconscious of her own sovereignty over the time. There are all the varying fortunes of butter-making recorded. Sometimes it comes merrily to the tune of \"Come, butter, come! Peter stands a-waiting at the gate, Waiting for his butter-cake. Come, butter, come! \" chanted in time with the dasher; again it doth willfully refuse, and then, lest it be too cool, we contribute a dash of hot water, or too hot, and we lend it a dash of cold. Or we toss in a magical handful of salt, to encourage it. Possibly, if we be not the thriftiest of householders, we feed the hens here in the yard, and then \"shoo\" them away, when they would fain take profligate dust-baths under the syringa, leaving unsightly hollows. But however, and with what complexion, our dooryards may face the later year, they begin it with purification. Here are they an unfailing index of the severer virtues; for, in Tiverton, there is no housewife who, in her spring cleaning, omits to set in order this outer pale of the temple. Long before the merry months are well under way, or the cows go kicking up their heels to pasture, or plants are taken from the south window and clapped into chilly ground, orderly passions begin to riot within us, and we \"clear up\" our yards. We gather stray chips, and pieces of bone brought in by the scavenger dog, who sits now with his tail tucked under him, oblivious of such vagrom ways. We rake the grass, and then, gilding refined gold, we sweep it. There is a tradition that Miss Lois May once went to the length of trimming her grass about the doorstone and clothes-pole with embroidery scissors ; but that was a too-hasty encomium bestowed by a widower whom she rejected next week, and who qualified his statement by saying they were pruning-shears. After this preliminary skirmishing arises much anxious inspection of ancient shrubs and the faithful among old-fashioned plants, to see whether they have \" stood the winter. \" The fresh, brown \"piny\" heads are brooded over with a motherly care; wormwood roots are loosened, and the horse-radish plant is given a thrifty touch. There is more than the delight of occupation in thus stirring the wheels of the year. We are Nature 's poor handmaidens, and our labor gives us joy. But sweet as these homespun spots can make themselves, in their mixture of thrift and prodigality, they are dearer than ever at the points where they register family traits, and so touch the humanity of us all. Here is imprinted the story of the man who owns the farm, that of the father who inherited it, and; the grandfather who reclaimed it from waste; here have they and their womenkind set the foot of daily living and traced indelible paths. They have left here the marks of tragedy, of pathos, or of joy. One yard has a level bit of grassless ground between barn and pump, and you may call it a battlefield, if you will, since famine and desire have striven there together. Or, if you choose to read fine meanings into threadbare things, you may see in it a field of the cloth of gold, where simple love of life and childlike pleasure met and sparkled for no eye to see. It was a croquet ground, laid out in the days when croquet first inundated the land, and laid out by a woman. This was Della Smith, the mother of two grave children, and the wife of a farmer who never learned to smile. Eben was duller than the ox which ploughs all day long for his handful of hay at night and his heavy slumber; but Della, though she carried her end of the yoke with a gallant spirit, had dreams and desires forever bursting from brown shells, only to live a moment in the air, and then, like bubbles, die. She had a perpetual appetite for joy. When the circus came to town, she walked miles to see the procession; and, in a dream of satisfied delight, dropped potatoes all the afternoon, to make up. Once, a hand-organ and monkey strayed that way, and it was she alone who followed them; for the children were little, and all the saner house-mothers contented themselves with leaning over the gates till the wandering train had passed. But Della drained her draught of joy to the dregs, and then tilted her cup anew. With croquet came her supremest joy,--one that leavened her days till God took her, somewhere, we hope, where there is playtime. Della had no money to buy a croquet set, but she had something far better, an alert and undiscouraged mind. On one dizzy afternoon, at a Fourth of July picnic, when wickets had been set up near the wood, she had played with the minister, and beaten him. The game opened before her an endless vista of delight. She saw herself perpetually knocking red-striped balls through an eternity of wickets; and she knew that here was the one pastime of which no soul could tire. Afterwards, driving home with her husband and two children, still in a daze of satisfied delight, she murmured absently:-- \"Wonder how much they cost? \" \" What? \" asked Eben, and Della turned, flushed scarlet, and replied:-- \"Oh, nothin'! \" That night, she lay awake for one rapt hour, and then she slept the sleep of conquerors. In the morning, after Eben had gone safely off to work, and the children were still asleep, she began singing, in a monotonous, high voice, and took her way out of doors. She always sang at moments when she purposed leaping the bounds of domestic custom. Even Eben had learned that, dull as he was. If he heard that guilty crooning from the buttery, he knew she might be breaking extra eggs, or using more sugar than was conformable. \"What you doin' of? \" he was accustomed to call. But Delia never answered, and he did not interfere. The question was a necessary concession to marital authority; he had no wish to curb her ways. Della scudded about the yard like a willful wind. She gathered withes from a waiting pile, and set them in that one level space for wickets. Then she took a handsaw, and, pale about the lips, returned to the house and to her bedroom. She had made her choice. She was sacrificing old associations to her present need; and, one after another, she sawed the ornamenting balls from her mother 's high-post bedstead. Perhaps the one element of tragedy lay in the fact that Della was no mechanician, and she had not foreseen that, having one flat side, her balls might decline to roll. But that dismay was brief. A weaker soul would have flinched; to Della it was a futile check, a pebble under the wave. She laid her balls calmly aside. Some day she would whittle them into shape; for there were always coming to Della days full of roomy leisure and large content. Meanwhile apples would serve her turn,--good alike to draw a weary mind out of its channel or teach the shape of spheres. And so, with two russets for balls and the clothes-slice for a mallet (the heavy sledge-hammer having failed), Della serenely, yet in triumph, played her first game against herself. \"Don't you drive over them wickets! \" she called imperiously, when Eben came up from the lot in his dingle cart.",

For, having once received the freedom of family living, you will own yourself disinclined to get beyond dooryards, those outer courts of domesticity. Homely joys spill over into them, and, when children are afoot, surge and riot there. In them do the common occupations of life find niche and channel . While bright weather holds, we wash out of doors on a Monday morning, the wash-bench in the solid block of shadow thrown by the house. We churn there, also, at the hour when Sweet-Breath, the cow, goes afield, modestly unconscious of her own sovereignty over the time. There are all the varying fortunes of butter-making recorded. Sometimes it comes merrily to the tune of \"Come, butter, come! Peter stands a-waiting at the gate, Waiting for his butter-cake. Come, butter, come! \" chanted in time with the dasher; again it doth willfully refuse, and then, lest it be too cool, we contribute a dash of hot water, or too hot, and we lend it a dash of cold. Or we toss in a magical handful of salt, to encourage it. Possibly, if we be not the thriftiest of householders, we feed the hens here in the yard, and then \"shoo\" them away, when they would fain take profligate dust-baths under the syringa, leaving unsightly hollows. But however, and with what complexion, our dooryards may face the later year, they begin it with purification. Here are they an unfailing index of the severer virtues; for, in Tiverton, there is no housewife who, in her spring cleaning, omits to set in order this outer pale of the temple. Long before the merry months are well under way, or the cows go kicking up their heels to pasture, or plants are taken from the south window and clapped into chilly ground, orderly passions begin to riot within us, and we \"clear up\" our yards. We gather stray chips, and pieces of bone brought in by the scavenger dog, who sits now with his tail tucked under him, oblivious of such vagrom ways. We rake the grass, and then, gilding refined gold, we sweep it. There is a tradition that Miss Lois May once went to the length of trimming her grass about the doorstone and clothes-pole with embroidery scissors ; but that was a too-hasty encomium bestowed by a widower whom she rejected next week, and who qualified his statement by saying they were pruning-shears. After this preliminary skirmishing arises much anxious inspection of ancient shrubs and the faithful among old-fashioned plants, to see whether they have \" stood the winter. \" The fresh, brown \"piny\" heads are brooded over with a motherly care; wormwood roots are loosened, and the horse-radish plant is given a thrifty touch. There is more than the delight of occupation in thus stirring the wheels of the year. We are Nature 's poor handmaidens, and our labor gives us joy. But sweet as these homespun spots can make themselves, in their mixture of thrift and prodigality, they are dearer than ever at the points where they register family traits, and so touch the humanity of us all. Here is imprinted the story of the man who owns the farm, that of the father who inherited it, and; the grandfather who reclaimed it from waste; here have they and their womenkind set the foot of daily living and traced indelible paths. They have left here the marks of tragedy, of pathos, or of joy. One yard has a level bit of grassless ground between barn and pump, and you may call it a battlefield, if you will, since famine and desire have striven there together. Or, if you choose to read fine meanings into threadbare things, you may see in it a field of the cloth of gold, where simple love of life and childlike pleasure met and sparkled for no eye to see. It was a croquet ground, laid out in the days when croquet first inundated the land, and laid out by a woman. This was Della Smith, the mother of two grave children, and the wife of a farmer who never learned to smile. Eben was duller than the ox which ploughs all day long for his handful of hay at night and his heavy slumber; but Della, though she carried her end of the yoke with a gallant spirit, had dreams and desires forever bursting from brown shells, only to live a moment in the air, and then, like bubbles, die. She had a perpetual appetite for joy. When the circus came to town, she walked miles to see the procession; and, in a dream of satisfied delight, dropped potatoes all the afternoon, to make up. Once, a hand-organ and monkey strayed that way, and it was she alone who followed them; for the children were little, and all the saner house-mothers contented themselves with leaning over the gates till the wandering train had passed. But Della drained her draught of joy to the dregs, and then tilted her cup anew. With croquet came her supremest joy,--one that leavened her days till God took her, somewhere, we hope, where there is playtime. Della had no money to buy a croquet set, but she had something far better, an alert and undiscouraged mind. On one dizzy afternoon, at a Fourth of July picnic, when wickets had been set up near the wood, she had played with the minister, and beaten him. The game opened before her an endless vista of delight. She saw herself perpetually knocking red-striped balls through an eternity of wickets; and she knew that here was the one pastime of which no soul could tire. Afterwards, driving home with her husband and two children, still in a daze of satisfied delight, she murmured absently:-- \"Wonder how much they cost? \" \" What? \" asked Eben, and Della turned, flushed scarlet, and replied:-- \"Oh, nothin'! \" That night, she lay awake for one rapt hour, and then she slept the sleep of conquerors. In the morning, after Eben had gone safely off to work, and the children were still asleep, she began singing, in a monotonous, high voice, and took her way out of doors. She always sang at moments when she purposed leaping the bounds of domestic custom. Even Eben had learned that, dull as he was. If he heard that guilty crooning from the buttery, he knew she might be breaking extra eggs, or using more sugar than was conformable. \"What you doin' of? \" he was accustomed to call. But Delia never answered, and he did not interfere. The question was a necessary concession to marital authority; he had no wish to curb her ways. Della scudded about the yard like a willful wind. She gathered withes from a waiting pile, and set them in that one level space for wickets. Then she took a handsaw, and, pale about the lips, returned to the house and to her bedroom. She had made her choice. She was sacrificing old associations to her present need; and, one after another, she sawed the ornamenting balls from her mother 's high-post bedstead. Perhaps the one element of tragedy lay in the fact that Della was no mechanician, and she had not foreseen that, having one flat side, her balls might decline to roll. But that dismay was brief. A weaker soul would have flinched; to Della it was a futile check, a pebble under the wave. She laid her balls calmly aside. Some day she would whittle them into shape; for there were always coming to Della days full of roomy leisure and large content. Meanwhile apples would serve her turn,--good alike to draw a weary mind out of its channel or teach the shape of spheres. And so, with two russets for balls and the clothes-slice for a mallet (the heavy sledge-hammer having failed), Della serenely, yet in triumph, played her first game against herself. \"Don't you drive over them wickets! \" she called imperiously, when Eben came up from the lot in his dingle cart. \"Them what? \" returned he, and Della had to go out to explain. He looked at them gravely; hers had been a ragged piece of work. \"What under the sun'd you do that for? \" he inquired. \" The young ones wouldn't turn their hand over for't They ain't big enough. \" \"Well, I be,\" said Della briefly. \"Don't you drive over 'em. \" Eben looked at her and then at his path to the barn, and he turned his horse aside. Thereafter, until we got used to it, we found a vivid source of interest in seeing Della playing croquet, and always playing alone.",

        "excerpt": "\"There! her smoke's a-goin'. \" Meantime, the tramp fell into all the usages of life indoors; and without, he worked revolution. He took his natural place at the head of affairs, and Amelia stood by, rejoicing. Her besetting error of doing things at the wrong moment had disarranged great combinations as well as small. Her impetuosity was constantly misleading her, bidding her try, this one time, whether harvest might not follow faster on the steps of spring. Enoch's mind was of another cast. For him, tradition reigned, and law was ever laying out the way. Some months after their marriage, Amelia had urged him to take away the winter banking about the house, for no reason save that the Mardens clung to theirs ; but he only replied that he'd known of cold snaps way on into May, and he guessed there was no particular hurry. The very next day brought a bitter air, laden with sleet, and Amelia, shivering at the open door, exulted in her feminine soul at finding him triumphant on his own ground. Enoch seemed, as usual, unconscious of victory. His immobility had no personal flavor. He merely acted from an inevitable devotion to the laws of life; and however often they might prove him right, he never seemed to reason that Amelia was consequently wrong. Perhaps that was what made it so pleasant to live with him. It was \"easy sleddin'\" now. Amelia grew very young. Her cheeks gained a bloom, her eyes brightened. She even, as the matrons noticed, took to crimping her hair. They looked on with a pitying awe. It seemed a fearsome thing, to do so much for a tramp who would only kill you in the end. Amelia stepped deftly about the house. She was a large woman, whose ways had been devoid of grace; but now the richness of her spiritual condition informed her with a charm. She crooned a little about her work. Singing voice she had none, but she grew into a way of putting words together, sometimes a line from the psalms, sometimes a name she loved, and chanting the sounds, in unrecorded melody. Meanwhile, little Rosie, always irreproachably dressed, with a jealous care lest she fall below the popular standard, roamed in and out of the house, and lightened its dull intervals. She, like the others, grew at once very happy, because, like them, she accepted her place without a qualm, as if it had been hers from the beginning. They were simple natures, and when their joy came, they knew how to meet it. But if Enoch was content to follow the beaten ways of life, there was one window through which he looked into the upper heaven of all: thereby he saw what it is to create. He was a born mechanician. A revolving wheel would set him to dreaming, and still him to that lethargy of mind which is an involuntary sharing in the things that are. He could lose himself in the life of rhythmic motion; and when he discovered rusted springs, or cogs unprepared to fulfill their purpose, he fell upon them with the ardor of a worshiper, and tried to set them right. Amelia thought he should have invented something, and he confessed that he had invented many things, but somehow failed in getting them on the market. That process he mentioned with the indifference of a man to whom a practical outcome is vague, and who finds in the ideal a bright reality. Even Amelia could see that to be a maker was his joy; to reap rewards of making was another and a lower task. One cold day in the early spring, he went \"up garret\" to hunt out an old saddle, gathering mildew there, and came upon a greater treasure, a disabled clock. He stepped heavily down, bearing it aloft in both hands. \"See here, 'Melia,\" asked he, \"why don't this go? \" Amelia was scouring tins on the kitchen table. There was a teasing wind outside, with a flurry of snow, and she had acknowledged that the irritating weather made her as nervous as a witch. So she had taken to a job to quiet herself. \"That clock? \" she replied. \" That was gran'ther Eli's. It give up strikin', an' then the hands stuck, an' I lost all patience with it. So I bought this nickel one, an' carted t'other off into the attic. 'T ain't worth fixin'. \" \"Worth it! \" repeated Enoch. \"Well, I guess I'll give it a chance. \" He drew a chair to the stove, and there hesitated. \"Say, 'Melia,\" said he, \"should you jest as soon I'd bring in that old shoemaker's bench out o' the shed? It's low, an' I could reach my tools off'n the floor. \" Amelia lacked the discipline of contact with her kind, but she was nevertheless smooth as silk in her new wifehood. \"Law, yes, bring it along,\" said she. \" It 's a good day to clutter up. The' won't be nobody in. \" So, while Enoch laid apart the clock with a delicacy of touch known only to square, mechanical fingers, and Rosie played with the button-box on the floor, assorting colors and matching white with white, Amelia scoured the tins. Her energy kept pace with the wind; it whirled in gusts and snatches, yet her precision never failed. \"Made up your mind which cow to sell? \" she asked, opening a discussion still unsettled, after days of animated talk. \"Ain't much to choose,\" said Enoch. He had frankly set Amelia right on the subject of livestock; and she smilingly acquiesced in his larger knowledge. \"Elbridge True's got a mighty nice Alderney, an' if he's goin' to sell milk another year, he'll be glad to get two good milkers like these. What he wants is ten quarts apiece, no matter if it 's bluer 'n a whetstone. I guess I can swap off with him; but I don't want to run arter him. I put the case last Thursday. Mebbe he'll drop round. \" \"Well,\" concluded Amelia, \"I guess you're pretty sure to do what's right. \" The forenoon galloped fast, and it was half past eleven before she thought of dinner. \"Why,\" said she, \"ain't it butcher day? I've been lottin' on a piece o' liver. \" \"Butcher day is Thursday,\" said Enoch. \"You've lost count. \" \"My land! \" responded Amelia. \"Well, I guess we can put up with some fried pork an' apples. \" There came a long, insistent knock at the outer door. \"Good heavens! Who's there! Rosie, you run to the side-light, an' peek. It can't be a neighbor. They'd come right in. I hope my soul it ain't company, a day like this. \" Rosie got on her fat legs with difficulty. She held her pinafore full of buttons, but disaster lies in doing too many things at once; there came a slip, a despairing clutch, and the buttons fell over the floor. There were a great, many round ones, and they rolled very fast. Amelia washed the sand from her parboiled fingers, and drew a nervous breath. She had a presentiment of coming ill, painfully heightened by her consciousness that the kitchen was \"riding out,\" and that she and her family rode with it. Rosie came running back from her peephole, husky with importance. The errant buttons did not trouble her. She had an eternity of time wherein to pick them up; and, indeed, the chances were that some tall, benevolent being would do it for her. \" It's a man,\" she said. \" He's got on a light coat with bright buttons, and a fuzzy hat. He's got a big nose. \" Now, indeed, despair entered into Amelia, and sat enthroned. She sank down on a straight-backed chair, and put her hands on her knees, while the knock came again, a little querulously. \"Enoch,\" said she, \"do you know what's happened? That's cousin Josiah Pease out there. \" Her voice bore the tragedy of a thousand past encounters; but that Enoch could not know. \" Is it? \" asked he, with but a mild appearance of interest. \"Want me to go to the door?\" \"Go to the door! \" echoed Amelia, so stridently that he looked up at her again. \" No; I don't want anybody should go to the door till this room's cleared up. If 't w'an't so ever-lastin' cold, I'd take him right into the clock-room, an' blaze a fire; but he'd see right through that. You gether up them tools an' things, an' I'll help carry out the bench. \" If Enoch had not just then been absorbed in a delicate combination of brass, he might have spoken more sympathetically. As it was, he seemed kindly, but remote. \"Look out! \" said he, \"you'll joggle. No, I guess I won't move. If he's any kind of a man, he'll know what 'tis to clean a clock. \" Amelia was not a crying woman, but the hot tears stood in her eyes. She was experiencing, for the first time, that helpless pang born from the wounding of pride in what we love. \"Don't you see, Enoch? \" she insisted. \" This room looks like the Old Boy --an' so do you--an' he'll go home an' tell all the folks at the Ridge. Why, he 's heard we're married, an' come over here to spy out the land. He hates the cold. He never stirs till 'way on into June; an' now he's come to find out. \" \"Find out what? \" inquired Enoch absorbedly. \"Well, if you're anyways put to 't, you send him to me. \" That manly utterance enunciated from a \"best-room\" sofa, by an Enoch clad in his Sunday suit, would have filled Amelia with rapture; she could have leaned on it as on the Tables of the Law. But, alas! the scene-setting was meagre, and though Enoch was very clean, he had no good clothes. He had pointedly refused to buy them with his wife's money until he should have worked on the farm to a corresponding amount. She had loved him for it; but every day his outer poverty hurt her pride. \" I guess you better ask him in, \" concluded Enoch. \"Don't you let him bother you. \" Amelia turned about with the grand air of a woman repulsed. \"He _don't_ bother me,\" said she, \"an' I _will_ let him in. \" She walked to the door, stepping on buttons as she went, and conscious, when she broke them, of a bitter pleasure. It added to her martyrdom. She flung open the door, and called herself a fool in the doing; for the little old man outside was in the act of turning away. In another instant, she might have escaped. But he was only too eager to come back again, and it seemed to Amelia as if he would run over her, in his desire to get in. \"There! there! 'Melia,\" said he, pushing past her, \"can't stop to talk till I git near the fire.",

        "excerpt": "\"There! her smoke's a-goin'. \" Meantime, the tramp fell into all the usages of life indoors; and without, he worked revolution. He took his natural place at the head of affairs, and Amelia stood by, rejoicing. Her besetting error of doing things at the wrong moment had disarranged great combinations as well as small. Her impetuosity was constantly misleading her, bidding her try, this one time, whether harvest might not follow faster on the steps of spring. Enoch's mind was of another cast. For him, tradition reigned, and law was ever laying out the way. Some months after their marriage, Amelia had urged him to take away the winter banking about the house, for no reason save that the Mardens clung to theirs ; but he only replied that he'd known of cold snaps way on into May, and he guessed there was no particular hurry. The very next day brought a bitter air, laden with sleet, and Amelia, shivering at the open door, exulted in her feminine soul at finding him triumphant on his own ground. Enoch seemed, as usual, unconscious of victory. His immobility had no personal flavor. He merely acted from an inevitable devotion to the laws of life; and however often they might prove him right, he never seemed to reason that Amelia was consequently wrong. Perhaps that was what made it so pleasant to live with him. It was \"easy sleddin'\" now. Amelia grew very young. Her cheeks gained a bloom, her eyes brightened. She even, as the matrons noticed, took to crimping her hair. They looked on with a pitying awe. It seemed a fearsome thing, to do so much for a tramp who would only kill you in the end. Amelia stepped deftly about the house. She was a large woman, whose ways had been devoid of grace; but now the richness of her spiritual condition informed her with a charm. She crooned a little about her work. Singing voice she had none, but she grew into a way of putting words together, sometimes a line from the psalms, sometimes a name she loved, and chanting the sounds, in unrecorded melody. Meanwhile, little Rosie, always irreproachably dressed, with a jealous care lest she fall below the popular standard, roamed in and out of the house, and lightened its dull intervals. She, like the others, grew at once very happy, because, like them, she accepted her place without a qualm, as if it had been hers from the beginning. They were simple natures, and when their joy came, they knew how to meet it. But if Enoch was content to follow the beaten ways of life, there was one window through which he looked into the upper heaven of all: thereby he saw what it is to create. He was a born mechanician. A revolving wheel would set him to dreaming, and still him to that lethargy of mind which is an involuntary sharing in the things that are. He could lose himself in the life of rhythmic motion; and when he discovered rusted springs, or cogs unprepared to fulfill their purpose, he fell upon them with the ardor of a worshiper, and tried to set them right. Amelia thought he should have invented something, and he confessed that he had invented many things, but somehow failed in getting them on the market. That process he mentioned with the indifference of a man to whom a practical outcome is vague, and who finds in the ideal a bright reality. Even Amelia could see that to be a maker was his joy; to reap rewards of making was another and a lower task. One cold day in the early spring, he went \"up garret\" to hunt out an old saddle, gathering mildew there, and came upon a greater treasure, a disabled clock. He stepped heavily down, bearing it aloft in both hands. \"See here, 'Melia,\" asked he, \"why don't this go? \" Amelia was scouring tins on the kitchen table. There was a teasing wind outside, with a flurry of snow, and she had acknowledged that the irritating weather made her as nervous as a witch. So she had taken to a job to quiet herself. \"That clock? \" she replied. \" That was gran'ther Eli's. It give up strikin', an' then the hands stuck, an' I lost all patience with it. So I bought this nickel one, an' carted t'other off into the attic. 'T ain't worth fixin'. \" \"Worth it! \" repeated Enoch. \"Well, I guess I'll give it a chance. \" He drew a chair to the stove, and there hesitated. \"Say, 'Melia,\" said he, \"should you jest as soon I'd bring in that old shoemaker's bench out o' the shed? It's low, an' I could reach my tools off'n the floor. \" Amelia lacked the discipline of contact with her kind, but she was nevertheless smooth as silk in her new wifehood. \"Law, yes, bring it along,\" said she. \" It 's a good day to clutter up. The' won't be nobody in. \" So, while Enoch laid apart the clock with a delicacy of touch known only to square, mechanical fingers, and Rosie played with the button-box on the floor, assorting colors and matching white with white, Amelia scoured the tins. Her energy kept pace with the wind; it whirled in gusts and snatches, yet her precision never failed. \"Made up your mind which cow to sell? \" she asked, opening a discussion still unsettled, after days of animated talk. \"Ain't much to choose,\" said Enoch. He had frankly set Amelia right on the subject of livestock; and she smilingly acquiesced in his larger knowledge. \"Elbridge True's got a mighty nice Alderney, an' if he's goin' to sell milk another year, he'll be glad to get two good milkers like these. What he wants is ten quarts apiece, no matter if it 's bluer 'n a whetstone. I guess I can swap off with him; but I don't want to run arter him. I put the case last Thursday. Mebbe he'll drop round. \" \"Well,\" concluded Amelia, \"I guess you're pretty sure to do what's right. \" The forenoon galloped fast, and it was half past eleven before she thought of dinner. \"Why,\" said she, \"ain't it butcher day? I've been lottin' on a piece o' liver. \" \"Butcher day is Thursday,\" said Enoch. \"You've lost count. \" \"My land! \" responded Amelia. \"Well, I guess we can put up with some fried pork an' apples. \" There came a long, insistent knock at the outer door. \"Good heavens! Who's there! Rosie, you run to the side-light, an' peek. It can't be a neighbor. They'd come right in. I hope my soul it ain't company, a day like this. \" Rosie got on her fat legs with difficulty. She held her pinafore full of buttons, but disaster lies in doing too many things at once; there came a slip, a despairing clutch, and the buttons fell over the floor. There were a great, many round ones, and they rolled very fast. Amelia washed the sand from her parboiled fingers, and drew a nervous breath. She had a presentiment of coming ill, painfully heightened by her consciousness that the kitchen was \"riding out,\" and that she and her family rode with it. Rosie came running back from her peephole, husky with importance. The errant buttons did not trouble her. She had an eternity of time wherein to pick them up; and, indeed, the chances were that some tall, benevolent being would do it for her. \" It's a man,\" she said. \" He's got on a light coat with bright buttons, and a fuzzy hat. He's got a big nose. \" Now, indeed, despair entered into Amelia, and sat enthroned. She sank down on a straight-backed chair, and put her hands on her knees, while the knock came again, a little querulously. \"Enoch,\" said she, \"do you know what's happened? That's cousin Josiah Pease out there. \" Her voice bore the tragedy of a thousand past encounters; but that Enoch could not know. \" Is it? \" asked he, with but a mild appearance of interest. \"Want me to go to the door?\" \"Go to the door! \" echoed Amelia, so stridently that he looked up at her again. \" No; I don't want anybody should go to the door till this room's cleared up. If 't w'an't so ever-lastin' cold, I'd take him right into the clock-room, an' blaze a fire; but he'd see right through that. You gether up them tools an' things, an' I'll help carry out the bench. \" If Enoch had not just then been absorbed in a delicate combination of brass, he might have spoken more sympathetically. As it was, he seemed kindly, but remote. \"Look out! \" said he, \"you'll joggle. No, I guess I won't move. If he's any kind of a man, he'll know what 'tis to clean a clock. \" Amelia was not a crying woman, but the hot tears stood in her eyes. She was experiencing, for the first time, that helpless pang born from the wounding of pride in what we love. \"Don't you see, Enoch? \" she insisted. \" This room looks like the Old Boy --an' so do you--an' he'll go home an' tell all the folks at the Ridge. Why, he 's heard we're married, an' come over here to spy out the land. He hates the cold. He never stirs till 'way on into June; an' now he's come to find out. \" \"Find out what? \" inquired Enoch absorbedly. \"Well, if you're anyways put to 't, you send him to me. \" That manly utterance enunciated from a \"best-room\" sofa, by an Enoch clad in his Sunday suit, would have filled Amelia with rapture; she could have leaned on it as on the Tables of the Law. But, alas! the scene-setting was meagre, and though Enoch was very clean, he had no good clothes. He had pointedly refused to buy them with his wife's money until he should have worked on the farm to a corresponding amount. She had loved him for it; but every day his outer poverty hurt her pride. \" I guess you better ask him in, \" concluded Enoch. \"Don't you let him bother you. \" Amelia turned about with the grand air of a woman repulsed. \"He _don't_ bother me,\" said she, \"an' I _will_ let him in. \" She walked to the door, stepping on buttons as she went, and conscious, when she broke them, of a bitter pleasure. It added to her martyrdom. She flung open the door, and called herself a fool in the doing; for the little old man outside was in the act of turning away. In another instant, she might have escaped. But he was only too eager to come back again, and it seemed to Amelia as if he would run over her, in his desire to get in. \"There! there! 'Melia,\" said he, pushing past her, \"can't stop to talk till I git near the fire.",

        "excerpt": "\" inquired Enoch absorbedly. \"Well, if you're anyways put to 't, you send him to me. \" That manly utterance enunciated from a \"best-room\" sofa, by an Enoch clad in his Sunday suit, would have filled Amelia with rapture; she could have leaned on it as on the Tables of the Law. But, alas! the scene-setting was meagre, and though Enoch was very clean, he had no good clothes. He had pointedly refused to buy them with his wife's money until he should have worked on the farm to a corresponding amount. She had loved him for it; but every day his outer poverty hurt her pride. \" I guess you better ask him in, \" concluded Enoch. \"Don't you let him bother you. \" Amelia turned about with the grand air of a woman repulsed. \"He _don't_ bother me,\" said she, \"an' I _will_ let him in. \" She walked to the door, stepping on buttons as she went, and conscious, when she broke them, of a bitter pleasure. It added to her martyrdom. She flung open the door, and called herself a fool in the doing; for the little old man outside was in the act of turning away. In another instant, she might have escaped. But he was only too eager to come back again, and it seemed to Amelia as if he would run over her, in his desire to get in. \"There! there! 'Melia,\" said he, pushing past her, \"can't stop to talk till I git near the fire. Guess you were settin' in the kitchen, wa'n't ye? Don't make no stranger o' me. That your man? \" She had shut the door, and entered, exasperated anew by the rising wind. \"That's my husband,\" said she coldly. \"Enoch, here's cousin Josiah Pease. \" Enoch looked up benevolently over his spectacles, and put out a horny left hand, the while the other guarded his heap of treasures . \" Pleased to meet you, sir,\" said he. \"You see I'm tinkerin' a clock. \" To Enoch, the explanation was enough. All the simple conventions of his life might well wait upon a reason potent as this. Josiah Pease went to the stove, and stood holding his tremulous hands over a cover. He was a little man, eclipsed in a butternut coat of many capes, and his parchment face shaded gradually up from it , as if into a harder medium. His eyes were light, and they had an exceedingly uncomfortable way of darting from one thing to another, like some insect born to spear and sting. His head was entirely bald, all save a thin fringe of hair not worth mentioning, since it disappeared so effectually beneath his collar; and his general antiquity was grotesquely emphasized by two sets of aggressive teeth, displaying their falsity from every crown. Amelia took out the broom, and began sweeping up buttons. She had an acrid consciousness that by sacrificing them she was somehow completing the tragedy of her day. Rosie gave a little cry; but Amelia pointed to the corner where stood the child 's chair, exhumed from the attic , after forty years of rest. \"You set there,\" she said, in an undertone, \"an' keep still. \" Rosie obeyed without a word. Such an atmosphere had not enveloped her since she entered this wonderful house. Remembering vaguely the days when her own mother had \"spells,\" and she and her father effaced themselves until times should change, she folded her little hands, and lapsed back into a condition of mental servitude . Meanwhile, Amelia followed nervously in the track of Enoch's talk with cousin Josiah, though her mind kept its undercurrent of foolish musing. Like all of us, snatched up by the wheels of great emergencies, she caught at trifles while they whirled her round. Here were \"soldier-buttons. \" All the other girls had collected them, though she, having no lover in the war, had traded for her few. Here were the gold-stones that held her changeable silk, there the little clouded pearls from her sister 's raglan. Annie had died in youth; its glamour still enwrapped her. Poor Annie! But Rosie had seemed to bring her back. Amelia swept litter, buttons and all, into the dustpan, and marched to the stove to throw her booty in. Nobody marked her save Rosie, whose playthings were endangered; but Enoch's very obtuseness to the situation was what stayed her hand. She carried the dustpan away into a closet, and came back, to gather up her tins. A cold rage of nervousness beset her, so overpowering that she herself was amazed at it. Meantime, Josiah Pease had divested himself of his coat, and drawn the grandfather chair into a space behind the stove. \"You a clock-mender by trade? \" he asked of Enoch. \" No,\" said Enoch absently, \"I ain't got any reg'lar trade. \" \" Jest goin' round the country? \" amended cousin Josiah, with the preliminary insinuation Amelia knew so well. He was, it had been said, in the habit of inventing lies, and challenging other folks to stick to 'em. But Enoch made no reply. He went soberly on with his work. \"Law, 'Melia, to think o' your bein' married,\" continued Josiah, turning to her. \" I never should ha' thought that o' you. \" \" I never thought it of myself,\" said Amelia tartly. \"You don't know what you'll do till you're tried. \" \" No! no! \" said Josiah Pease. \" Never in the world. You remember Sally Flint, how plain-spoken she is? Well, Betsy Harden 's darter Ann rode down to the poor-house t'other day with some sweet trade, an' took a young sprig with her . He turned his back a minute, to look out o' winder, an' Sally spoke right up, as ye might say, afore him. 'That your beau? ' says she. Well, o' course Ann couldn't own it, an' him right there, so to speak. So she shook her head. 'Well, I'm glad on 't,' says Sally. 'If I couldn't have anything to eat, I'd have suthin' to look at! ' He was the most unsignifyin'est creatur' you ever put your eyes on. But they say Ann's started in on her clo'es. \" Amelia's face had grown scarlet. \" I dunno 's any such speech is called for here,\" said she, in a furious self-betrayal. Josiah Pease had always been able to storm her reserves. \"Law, no,\" answered he comfortably. \" It come into my mind,--that's all. \" She looked at Enoch with a passionate sympathy, knowing too well how the hidden sting was intended to work. But Enoch had not heard. He was absorbed in a finer problem of brass and iron; and though Amelia had wished to save him from hurt, in that instant she scorned him for his blindness. \" I guess I shall have to ask you to move,\" she said to her husband coldly. \"I've got to git to that stove, if we're goin' to have any dinner to-day. \" It seemed to her that even Enoch might take the hint, and clear away his rubbish. Her feelings might have been assuaged by a clean hearth and some acquiescence in her own mood. But he only moved back a little, and went on fitting and musing. He was not thinking of her in the least, nor even of Josiah Pease. His mind had entered its brighter, more alluring world. She began to fry her pork and apples, with a perfunctory attempt at conversation. \"You don't often git round so early in the spring,\" said she. \" No,\" returned cousin Josiah. \"I kind o' got started out, this time, I don't rightly know why. I guess I've had you in mind more of late, for some Tiverton folks come over our way, tradin', an' they brought all the news. It sort o' stirred me up to come. \" Amelia turned her apples vigorously, well aware that the slices were breaking. That made a part of her bitter day. \"Folks needn't take the trouble to carry news about me,\" she said. There was an angry gleam in her eyes. \" If anybody wants to know anything, let 'em come right here, an' I'll settle 'em. \" The ring of her voice penetrated even to Enoch 's perception, and he looked up in mild surprise. She seemed to have thrown open, for an instant, a little window into a part of her nature he had never seen. \" How good them apples smell! \" said Josiah innocently. \" Last time I had 'em was down to cousin Amasa True's, he that married his third wife, an' she run through all he had. I went down to see 'em arter the vandoo,--you know they got red o' most everything,--an' they had fried pork an' apples for dinner. Old Bashaby dropped in. 'Law!' says she. 'Fried pork an' apples! Well, I call that livin' pretty nigh the wind! '\" Josiah chuckled. He was very warm now, and the savory smell of the dish he decried was mounting to what served him for fancy. \"'Melia, you ain't never had your teeth out, have ye? \" he asked, as one who spoke from richer memories. \" I guess my teeth'll last me as long as I want 'em,\" said Amelia curtly . \"Well, I didn't know. They looked real white an ' firm last time I see 'em, but you never can tell how they be underneath. I knew the folks would ask me when I got home. I thought I'd speak. \" \"Dinner 's ready,\" said Amelia. She turned an alien look upon her husband. \"You want to wash your hands? \" Enoch rose cheerfully. He had got to a hopeful place with the clock. \" Set ri' down,\" said he. \"Don't wait a minute. I'll be along. \" So Amelia and the guest began their meal, while little Rosie climbed, rather soberly, into her higher chair, and held out her plate. \"You wait,\" said Amelia harshly. \" Can't you let other folks eat a mouthful before you have to have yours? \" Yet as she said it, she remembered, with a remorseful pang, that she had always helped the child first; it had been so sweet to see her pleased and satisfied. Josiah was never talkative during meals. Not being absolute master of his teeth, his mind dwelt with them. Amelia remembered that, with a malicious satisfaction. But he could not be altogether dumb. That, people said, would never happen to Josiah Pease while he was above ground. \"That his girl? \" he asked, indicating Rosie with his knife, in a gustatory pause. \"Whose? \" inquired Amelia willfully. \"His.",

With the clanging of the door, she felt secure. If she had to deal with Josiah Pease, she could do it better alone, clutching at the certainty that was with her from of old, that, if you could only keep your temper with cousin Josiah, you had one chance of victory. Flame out at him, and you were lost. \"Some more potatoes? \" asked she, with a deceptive calm. \"Don't care if I do,\" returned Josiah, selecting greedily, his fork hovering in air. \" Little mite watery, ain't they? Dig 'em yourself? \" \" We dug 'em,\" said Amelia coldly . Rosie stepped down from her chair, unnoticed. To Amelia, she was then no bigger than some little winged thing flitting about the room in time of tragedy. Our greatest emotions sometimes stay unnamed. At that moment, Amelia was swayed by as tumultuous a love as ever animated damsel of verse or story; but it merely seemed to her that she was an ill-used woman, married to a man for whom she was called on to be ashamed. Rosie tiptoed into the entry, put on her little shawl and hood, and stole out to play in the corn-house. When domestic squalls were gathering, she knew where to go. The great outdoors was safer. Her past had taught her that. \"Don't like to eat with folks, does he? Well, it 's all in what you're brought up to. \" Amelia was ready with her counter-charge. \" Have some tea? \" She poured it as if it were poison, and Josiah became conscious of her tragic self-control. \"You ain't eat a thing,\" said he, with an ostentatious kindliness. He bent forward a little, with the air of inviting a confidence. \"Got suthin' on your mind, ain't you, 'Melia? \" he whispered. \"Kind o' worried? Find he 's a drinkin' man? \" Amelia was not to be beguiled, even by that anger which veils itself as justice . She looked at him steadily, with scorching eyes. \"You ain't took any sugar,\" said she. \"There 't is, settin' by you. Help yourself. \" Josiah addressed himself to his tea, and then Amelia poured him another cup. She had some fierce satisfaction in making it good and strong. It seemed to her that she was heartening her adversary for the fray, and she took pleasure in doing it effectually . So great was the spirit within her that she knew he could not be too valiant, for her keener joy in laying him low. Then they rose from the table, and Josiah took his old place by the stove, while Amelia began carrying the dishes to the sink. Her mind was a little hazy now; her next move must depend on his, and cousin Josiah, somewhat drowsy from his good dinner, was not at once inclined to talk. Suddenly he raised his head snakily from those sunken shoulders, and pointed a lean finger to the window. \"'Melia! \" cried he sharply. \"I'll be buttered if he ain't been and traded off both your cows. My Lord! be you goin' to stan' there an' let them two cows go? \" Amelia gave one swift glance from the window, following the path marked out by that insinuating index. It was true. Elbridge was driving her two cows out of the yard, and her husband stood by, watching him. She walked quietly into the entry, and Josiah laid his old hands together in the rapturous certainty that she was going to open the door, and send her anger forth. But Amelia only took down his butternut coat from the nail, and returned with it, holding it ready for him to insert his arms. \"Here's your coat,\" said she, with that strange, deceptive calmness. \"Stan' up, an' I'll help you put it on . \" Josiah looked at her with helplessly open mouth, and eyes so vacuous that Amelia felt, even at that moment, the grim humor of his plight. \"I was in hopes he'd harness up\"--he began, but she ruthlessly cut him short. \"Stan' up! Here, put t'other arm in fust. This han'kercher yours? Goes round your neck? There 't is. Here's your hat. Got any mittens? There they be, in your pocket. This way. This is the door you come in, an' this is the door you'll go out of. \" She preceded him, her head thrown up, her shoulders back. Amelia had no idea of dramatic values, but she was playing an effective part. She reached the door and flung it open, but Josiah, a poor figure in its huddled capes, still stood abjectly in the middle of the kitchen. \" Come! \" she called peremptorily. \"Come, Josiah Pease! Out you go. \" And Josiah went, though, contrary to his usual habit, he did not talk . He quavered uncertainly down the steps, and Amelia called a halt . \"Josiah Pease!\" He turned, and looked up at her. His mouth had dropped, and he was nothing but a very helpless old child. Vicious as he was, Amelia realized the mental poverty of her adversary, and despised herself for despising him. \" Josiah Pease! \" she repeated. \" This is the end. Don't you darken my doors ag'in. I've done with you,--egg an' bird! \" She closed the door, shutting out Josiah and the keen spring wind, and went back to the window, to watch him down the drive. His back looked poor and mean. It emphasized the pettiness of her victory. Even at that moment, she realized that it was the poorer part of her which had resented attack on a citadel which should be impregnable as time itself. Just then Enoch stepped into the kitchen behind her, and his voice jarred upon her tingling nerves . \"Well,\" said he, more jovially than he was wont to speak, \"I guess I've made a good trade for ye. Company gone? Come here an' se' down while I eat, an' I'll tell ye all about it. \" Amelia turned about and walked slowly up to him, by no volition of her conscious self. Again love, that august creature, veiled itself in an unjust anger, because it was love and nothing else. \"You've made a good bargain, have you? \" she repeated. \"You've sold my cows, an' had 'em drove off the place without if or but. That's what you call a good bargain! \" Her voice frightened her. It amazed the man who heard. These two middle-aged people were waking up to passions neither had felt in youth. Life was strong in them because love was there. \" Why, 'Melia! \" said the man. \" Why, 'Melia! \" Amelia was hurried on before the wind of her destiny. Her voice grew sharper. Little white stripes, like the lashes from a whip, showed themselves on her cheeks. She seemed to be speaking from a dream, which left her no will save that of speaking. \" It 's been so ever sence you set foot in this house. Have I had my say once? Have I been mistress on my own farm? No! You took the head o' things, an' you've kep' it. What's mine is yours. \" Her triumph over Josiah seemed to be strangely repeated; the scene was almost identical. The man before her stood with his hands hanging by his sides, the fingers limp, in an attitude of the profoundest patience. He was thinking things out. She knew that. Her hurrying mind anticipated all he might have said, and would not. And because he had too abiding a gentleness to say it, the insanity of her anger rose anew. \"I'm the laughin'-stock o' the town,\" she went on bitterly. \"There ain't a man or woman in it that don't say I've married a tramp. \" Enoch winced, with a sharp, brief quiver of the lips; but before she could dwell upon the sight, to the resurrection of her tenderness, he turned away from her, and went over to the bench. \" I guess I'll move this back where't was,\" he said, in a very still voice, and Amelia stood watching him, conscious of a new and bitterer pang: a fierce contempt that he could go on with his poor, methodical way of living, when greater issues waited at the door. He moved the bench into its old place, gathered up the clock, with its dismantled machinery, and carried it into the attic. She heard his step on the stairs, regular and unhalting, and despised him again; but in all those moments, the meaning of his movements had not struck her. When he came back, he brought in the broom; and while he swept up the fragments of his work, Amelia stood and watched him. He carried the dustpan and broom away to their places, but he did not reenter the room. He spoke to her from the doorway, and she could not see his face. \" I guess you won't mind if I leave the clock as 'tis. It needs some new cogs, an' if anybody should come along, he wouldn't find it any the worse for what I've done. I've jest thought it over about the cows, an' I guess I'll leave that, too, jest as it is.",

With the clanging of the door, she felt secure. If she had to deal with Josiah Pease, she could do it better alone, clutching at the certainty that was with her from of old, that, if you could only keep your temper with cousin Josiah, you had one chance of victory. Flame out at him, and you were lost. \"Some more potatoes? \" asked she, with a deceptive calm. \"Don't care if I do,\" returned Josiah, selecting greedily, his fork hovering in air. \" Little mite watery, ain't they? Dig 'em yourself? \" \" We dug 'em,\" said Amelia coldly . Rosie stepped down from her chair, unnoticed. To Amelia, she was then no bigger than some little winged thing flitting about the room in time of tragedy. Our greatest emotions sometimes stay unnamed. At that moment, Amelia was swayed by as tumultuous a love as ever animated damsel of verse or story; but it merely seemed to her that she was an ill-used woman, married to a man for whom she was called on to be ashamed. Rosie tiptoed into the entry, put on her little shawl and hood, and stole out to play in the corn-house. When domestic squalls were gathering, she knew where to go. The great outdoors was safer. Her past had taught her that. \"Don't like to eat with folks, does he? Well, it 's all in what you're brought up to. \" Amelia was ready with her counter-charge. \" Have some tea? \" She poured it as if it were poison, and Josiah became conscious of her tragic self-control. \"You ain't eat a thing,\" said he, with an ostentatious kindliness. He bent forward a little, with the air of inviting a confidence. \"Got suthin' on your mind, ain't you, 'Melia? \" he whispered. \"Kind o' worried? Find he 's a drinkin' man? \" Amelia was not to be beguiled, even by that anger which veils itself as justice . She looked at him steadily, with scorching eyes. \"You ain't took any sugar,\" said she. \"There 't is, settin' by you. Help yourself. \" Josiah addressed himself to his tea, and then Amelia poured him another cup. She had some fierce satisfaction in making it good and strong. It seemed to her that she was heartening her adversary for the fray, and she took pleasure in doing it effectually . So great was the spirit within her that she knew he could not be too valiant, for her keener joy in laying him low. Then they rose from the table, and Josiah took his old place by the stove, while Amelia began carrying the dishes to the sink. Her mind was a little hazy now; her next move must depend on his, and cousin Josiah, somewhat drowsy from his good dinner, was not at once inclined to talk. Suddenly he raised his head snakily from those sunken shoulders, and pointed a lean finger to the window. \"'Melia! \" cried he sharply. \"I'll be buttered if he ain't been and traded off both your cows. My Lord! be you goin' to stan' there an' let them two cows go? \" Amelia gave one swift glance from the window, following the path marked out by that insinuating index. It was true. Elbridge was driving her two cows out of the yard, and her husband stood by, watching him. She walked quietly into the entry, and Josiah laid his old hands together in the rapturous certainty that she was going to open the door, and send her anger forth. But Amelia only took down his butternut coat from the nail, and returned with it, holding it ready for him to insert his arms. \"Here's your coat,\" said she, with that strange, deceptive calmness. \"Stan' up, an' I'll help you put it on . \" Josiah looked at her with helplessly open mouth, and eyes so vacuous that Amelia felt, even at that moment, the grim humor of his plight. \"I was in hopes he'd harness up\"--he began, but she ruthlessly cut him short. \"Stan' up! Here, put t'other arm in fust. This han'kercher yours? Goes round your neck? There 't is. Here's your hat. Got any mittens? There they be, in your pocket. This way. This is the door you come in, an' this is the door you'll go out of. \" She preceded him, her head thrown up, her shoulders back. Amelia had no idea of dramatic values, but she was playing an effective part. She reached the door and flung it open, but Josiah, a poor figure in its huddled capes, still stood abjectly in the middle of the kitchen. \" Come! \" she called peremptorily. \"Come, Josiah Pease! Out you go. \" And Josiah went, though, contrary to his usual habit, he did not talk . He quavered uncertainly down the steps, and Amelia called a halt . \"Josiah Pease!\" He turned, and looked up at her. His mouth had dropped, and he was nothing but a very helpless old child. Vicious as he was, Amelia realized the mental poverty of her adversary, and despised herself for despising him. \" Josiah Pease! \" she repeated. \" This is the end. Don't you darken my doors ag'in. I've done with you,--egg an' bird! \" She closed the door, shutting out Josiah and the keen spring wind, and went back to the window, to watch him down the drive. His back looked poor and mean. It emphasized the pettiness of her victory. Even at that moment, she realized that it was the poorer part of her which had resented attack on a citadel which should be impregnable as time itself. Just then Enoch stepped into the kitchen behind her, and his voice jarred upon her tingling nerves . \"Well,\" said he, more jovially than he was wont to speak, \"I guess I've made a good trade for ye. Company gone? Come here an' se' down while I eat, an' I'll tell ye all about it. \" Amelia turned about and walked slowly up to him, by no volition of her conscious self. Again love, that august creature, veiled itself in an unjust anger, because it was love and nothing else. \"You've made a good bargain, have you? \" she repeated. \"You've sold my cows, an' had 'em drove off the place without if or but. That's what you call a good bargain! \" Her voice frightened her. It amazed the man who heard. These two middle-aged people were waking up to passions neither had felt in youth. Life was strong in them because love was there. \" Why, 'Melia! \" said the man. \" Why, 'Melia! \" Amelia was hurried on before the wind of her destiny. Her voice grew sharper. Little white stripes, like the lashes from a whip, showed themselves on her cheeks. She seemed to be speaking from a dream, which left her no will save that of speaking. \" It 's been so ever sence you set foot in this house. Have I had my say once? Have I been mistress on my own farm? No! You took the head o' things, an' you've kep' it. What's mine is yours. \" Her triumph over Josiah seemed to be strangely repeated; the scene was almost identical. The man before her stood with his hands hanging by his sides, the fingers limp, in an attitude of the profoundest patience. He was thinking things out. She knew that. Her hurrying mind anticipated all he might have said, and would not. And because he had too abiding a gentleness to say it, the insanity of her anger rose anew. \"I'm the laughin'-stock o' the town,\" she went on bitterly. \"There ain't a man or woman in it that don't say I've married a tramp. \" Enoch winced, with a sharp, brief quiver of the lips; but before she could dwell upon the sight, to the resurrection of her tenderness, he turned away from her, and went over to the bench. \" I guess I'll move this back where't was,\" he said, in a very still voice, and Amelia stood watching him, conscious of a new and bitterer pang: a fierce contempt that he could go on with his poor, methodical way of living, when greater issues waited at the door. He moved the bench into its old place, gathered up the clock, with its dismantled machinery, and carried it into the attic. She heard his step on the stairs, regular and unhalting, and despised him again; but in all those moments, the meaning of his movements had not struck her. When he came back, he brought in the broom; and while he swept up the fragments of his work, Amelia stood and watched him. He carried the dustpan and broom away to their places, but he did not reenter the room. He spoke to her from the doorway, and she could not see his face. \" I guess you won't mind if I leave the clock as 'tis. It needs some new cogs, an' if anybody should come along, he wouldn't find it any the worse for what I've done. I've jest thought it over about the cows, an' I guess I'll leave that, too, jest as it is.",

They also remarked that her nose was as picked as a pin, and that anybody with them freckles and that red hair was sure to be smart. You could always tell. Mrs. Robbins knew her reputation for extreme acuteness, and tried to live up to it. \"Law! don't you go to stirrin' on him up,\" said Mrs. Solomon Page comfortably, putting on the cover of her butter-box, which had contained the family lunch. \"If the store 's closed, he can slip the letter into the box, an' three cents with it, an' they'll put a stamp on in the mornin'. \" By this time, there was a general dusting of crumbs from Sunday gowns, a settling of boxes and baskets, and the feminine portion of the East Tiverton congregation, according to ancient custom, passed into the pews nearest the stove, and arranged itself more compactly for the midday gossip. This was a pleasant interlude in the religious decorum of the day; no Sunday came when the men did not trail off to the store for their special council, and the women, with a restful sense of sympathy alloyed by no disturbing element, settled down for an exclusively feminine view of the universe. Mrs. Page took the head of the pew, and disposed her portly frame so as to survey the scene with ease. She was a large woman, with red cheeks and black, shining hair. One powerful arm lay along the back of the pew, and, as she talked, she meditatively beat the rail in time. Her sister, Mrs. Ellison, according to an intermittent custom, had come over from Saltash to attend church, and incidentally to indulge in a family chat. It was said that Tilly rode over about jes' so often to get the Tiverton news for her son Leonard, who furnished local items to the Sudleigh \"Star; \" and, indeed, she made no secret of sitting down in social conclave with a bit of paper and a worn pencil in hand, to jog her memory. She, too, had smooth black hair, but her dark eyes were illumined by no steadfast glow; they snapped and shone with alert intelligence, and her great forehead dominated the rest of her face, scarred with a thousand wrinkles by intensity of nature rather than by time . A pleasant warmth had diffused itself over the room, so cold during the morning service that foot-stoves had been in requisition. Bonnet strings were thrown back and shawls unpinned. The little world relaxed and lay at ease. \"What's the news over your way, sister? \" asked Mrs. Ellison, as an informal preliminary. \"Tilly don't want to give; she'd ruther take,\" said Mrs. Baxter, before the other could answer. \"She's like old Mis' Pepper. Seliny Hazlitt went over there, when she was fust married an' come to the neighborhood an' asked her if she'd got a sieve to put squash through . Poor Seliny! she didn't know a sieve from a colander, in them days. \" \" I guess she found out soon enough, \" volunteered Mrs. Page. \"_ He_ was one o' them kind o' men that can keep house as well as a woman. I'd ruther live with a born fool. \" \"Well, old Mis' Pepper she ris up an' smoothed down her apron (recollect them little dots she used to wear?--made her look as broad as a barn door!), an' she says, 'Yes, we've got a sieve for flour, an' a sieve for meal, an' a sieve for rye, an' a sieve for blue-monge, an' we could have a sieve for squash if we was a mind to, _but I don't wish to lend _. ' That's the way with Tilly. She's terrible cropein' about news, but she won't lend. \" \" How 's your cistern? \" asked Mrs. John Cole, who, with an exclusively practical turn of mind, saw no reason why talk should be consecutive. \"Got all the water you want?\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Page; \" that last rain filled it up higher'n it's been sence November. \" But Mrs. Ellison was not to be thrown off the track. \" Ain't there been consid'able talk over here about Parson Bond? \" she asked. Miss Sally Ware, a plump and pleasing maiden lady, whose gold beads lay in a crease especially designed for them, stirred uneasily in her seat and gave her sisters an appealing glance. But she did not speak, beyond uttering a little dissentient noise in her throat. She was loyal to her minister. An embarrassed silence fell like a vapor over the assemblage. Everybody longed to talk; nobody wanted the responsibility of beginning. Mrs. Page was the first to gather her forces. \"Now, Tilly,\" said she, with decision, \"you ain't comin' over here to tole us into haulin' our own pastor over the coals, unless you'll say right out you won't pass it on to Saltash folks.",

        "excerpt": "Mrs. Robbins, \"le's se' down an' talk it over. \" The last man of all the crowd accustomed to seek the country store at noontime was closing the church door behind him as she spoke. \"Here, Ezry,\" she called after him, \"you hurry up, or you won't git there afore cockcrow to-morrer, an' I wouldn't have that letter miss for a good deal. \" Mrs. Robbins was slight, and hung on wires,--so said her neighbors. They also remarked that her nose was as picked as a pin, and that anybody with them freckles and that red hair was sure to be smart. You could always tell. Mrs. Robbins knew her reputation for extreme acuteness, and tried to live up to it. \"Law! don't you go to stirrin' on him up,\" said Mrs. Solomon Page comfortably, putting on the cover of her butter-box, which had contained the family lunch. \"If the store 's closed, he can slip the letter into the box, an' three cents with it, an' they'll put a stamp on in the mornin'. \" By this time, there was a general dusting of crumbs from Sunday gowns, a settling of boxes and baskets, and the feminine portion of the East Tiverton congregation, according to ancient custom, passed into the pews nearest the stove, and arranged itself more compactly for the midday gossip. This was a pleasant interlude in the religious decorum of the day; no Sunday came when the men did not trail off to the store for their special council, and the women, with a restful sense of sympathy alloyed by no disturbing element, settled down for an exclusively feminine view of the universe. Mrs. Page took the head of the pew, and disposed her portly frame so as to survey the scene with ease. She was a large woman, with red cheeks and black, shining hair. One powerful arm lay along the back of the pew, and, as she talked, she meditatively beat the rail in time. Her sister, Mrs. Ellison, according to an intermittent custom, had come over from Saltash to attend church, and incidentally to indulge in a family chat. It was said that Tilly rode over about jes' so often to get the Tiverton news for her son Leonard, who furnished local items to the Sudleigh \"Star; \" and, indeed, she made no secret of sitting down in social conclave with a bit of paper and a worn pencil in hand, to jog her memory. She, too, had smooth black hair, but her dark eyes were illumined by no steadfast glow; they snapped and shone with alert intelligence, and her great forehead dominated the rest of her face, scarred with a thousand wrinkles by intensity of nature rather than by time . A pleasant warmth had diffused itself over the room, so cold during the morning service that foot-stoves had been in requisition. Bonnet strings were thrown back and shawls unpinned. The little world relaxed and lay at ease. \"What's the news over your way, sister? \" asked Mrs. Ellison, as an informal preliminary. \"Tilly don't want to give; she'd ruther take,\" said Mrs. Baxter, before the other could answer. \"She's like old Mis' Pepper. Seliny Hazlitt went over there, when she was fust married an' come to the neighborhood an' asked her if she'd got a sieve to put squash through . Poor Seliny! she didn't know a sieve from a colander, in them days. \" \" I guess she found out soon enough, \" volunteered Mrs. Page. \"_ He_ was one o' them kind o' men that can keep house as well as a woman. I'd ruther live with a born fool. \" \"Well, old Mis' Pepper she ris up an' smoothed down her apron (recollect them little dots she used to wear?--made her look as broad as a barn door!), an' she says, 'Yes, we've got a sieve for flour, an' a sieve for meal, an' a sieve for rye, an' a sieve for blue-monge, an' we could have a sieve for squash if we was a mind to, _but I don't wish to lend _. ' That's the way with Tilly. She's terrible cropein' about news, but she won't lend. \" \" How 's your cistern? \" asked Mrs. John Cole, who, with an exclusively practical turn of mind, saw no reason why talk should be consecutive. \"Got all the water you want?\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Page; \" that last rain filled it up higher'n it's been sence November. \" But Mrs. Ellison was not to be thrown off the track. \" Ain't there been consid'able talk over here about Parson Bond? \" she asked. Miss Sally Ware, a plump and pleasing maiden lady, whose gold beads lay in a crease especially designed for them, stirred uneasily in her seat and gave her sisters an appealing glance. But she did not speak, beyond uttering a little dissentient noise in her throat. She was loyal to her minister. An embarrassed silence fell like a vapor over the assemblage. Everybody longed to talk; nobody wanted the responsibility of beginning. Mrs. Page was the first to gather her forces. \"Now, Tilly,\" said she, with decision, \"you ain't comin' over here to tole us into haulin' our own pastor over the coals, unless you'll say right out you won't pass it on to Saltash folks.",

        "excerpt": "Mrs. Robbins, \"le's se' down an' talk it over. \" The last man of all the crowd accustomed to seek the country store at noontime was closing the church door behind him as she spoke. \"Here, Ezry,\" she called after him, \"you hurry up, or you won't git there afore cockcrow to-morrer, an' I wouldn't have that letter miss for a good deal. \" Mrs. Robbins was slight, and hung on wires,--so said her neighbors. They also remarked that her nose was as picked as a pin, and that anybody with them freckles and that red hair was sure to be smart. You could always tell. Mrs. Robbins knew her reputation for extreme acuteness, and tried to live up to it. \"Law! don't you go to stirrin' on him up,\" said Mrs. Solomon Page comfortably, putting on the cover of her butter-box, which had contained the family lunch. \"If the store 's closed, he can slip the letter into the box, an' three cents with it, an' they'll put a stamp on in the mornin'. \" By this time, there was a general dusting of crumbs from Sunday gowns, a settling of boxes and baskets, and the feminine portion of the East Tiverton congregation, according to ancient custom, passed into the pews nearest the stove, and arranged itself more compactly for the midday gossip. This was a pleasant interlude in the religious decorum of the day; no Sunday came when the men did not trail off to the store for their special council, and the women, with a restful sense of sympathy alloyed by no disturbing element, settled down for an exclusively feminine view of the universe. Mrs. Page took the head of the pew, and disposed her portly frame so as to survey the scene with ease. She was a large woman, with red cheeks and black, shining hair. One powerful arm lay along the back of the pew, and, as she talked, she meditatively beat the rail in time. Her sister, Mrs. Ellison, according to an intermittent custom, had come over from Saltash to attend church, and incidentally to indulge in a family chat. It was said that Tilly rode over about jes' so often to get the Tiverton news for her son Leonard, who furnished local items to the Sudleigh \"Star; \" and, indeed, she made no secret of sitting down in social conclave with a bit of paper and a worn pencil in hand, to jog her memory. She, too, had smooth black hair, but her dark eyes were illumined by no steadfast glow; they snapped and shone with alert intelligence, and her great forehead dominated the rest of her face, scarred with a thousand wrinkles by intensity of nature rather than by time . A pleasant warmth had diffused itself over the room, so cold during the morning service that foot-stoves had been in requisition. Bonnet strings were thrown back and shawls unpinned. The little world relaxed and lay at ease. \"What's the news over your way, sister? \" asked Mrs. Ellison, as an informal preliminary. \"Tilly don't want to give; she'd ruther take,\" said Mrs. Baxter, before the other could answer. \"She's like old Mis' Pepper. Seliny Hazlitt went over there, when she was fust married an' come to the neighborhood an' asked her if she'd got a sieve to put squash through . Poor Seliny! she didn't know a sieve from a colander, in them days. \" \" I guess she found out soon enough, \" volunteered Mrs. Page. \"_ He_ was one o' them kind o' men that can keep house as well as a woman. I'd ruther live with a born fool. \" \"Well, old Mis' Pepper she ris up an' smoothed down her apron (recollect them little dots she used to wear?--made her look as broad as a barn door!), an' she says, 'Yes, we've got a sieve for flour, an' a sieve for meal, an' a sieve for rye, an' a sieve for blue-monge, an' we could have a sieve for squash if we was a mind to, _but I don't wish to lend _. ' That's the way with Tilly. She's terrible cropein' about news, but she won't lend. \" \" How 's your cistern? \" asked Mrs. John Cole, who, with an exclusively practical turn of mind, saw no reason why talk should be consecutive. \"Got all the water you want?\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Page; \" that last rain filled it up higher'n it's been sence November. \" But Mrs. Ellison was not to be thrown off the track. \" Ain't there been consid'able talk over here about Parson Bond? \" she asked. Miss Sally Ware, a plump and pleasing maiden lady, whose gold beads lay in a crease especially designed for them, stirred uneasily in her seat and gave her sisters an appealing glance. But she did not speak, beyond uttering a little dissentient noise in her throat. She was loyal to her minister. An embarrassed silence fell like a vapor over the assemblage. Everybody longed to talk; nobody wanted the responsibility of beginning. Mrs. Page was the first to gather her forces. \"Now, Tilly,\" said she, with decision, \"you ain't comin' over here to tole us into haulin' our own pastor over the coals, unless you'll say right out you won't pass it on to Saltash folks. As for puttin' it in the paper, it ain't the kind you can. \" Tilly's eyes burned. \" I guess I know when to speak an ' when not to,\" she remarked. \"Now don't beat about the bush; the men-folks'll be back to rights. I never in my life give Len a mite o' news he couldn't ha' picked up for himself. \" \"Well, some master silly pieces have got into the paper, fust an' last,\" said Mrs. Robbins. \"Recollect how your Len come 'way over here to git his shoes cobbled, the week arter Tom Brewer moved int' the Holler, an' folks hadn't got over swappin' the queer things he said? an' when Tom got the shoes done afore he promised, Len says to him, 'You're better'n your word. ' 'Well,' says Tom, 'I flew at 'em with all the venom o' my specie. ' An' it wa'n't a fortnight afore that speech come out in a New York paper, an' then the Sudleigh 'Star' got hold on 't, an' so 't went. If folks want that kind o' thing, they can git a plenty, _I _ say. \" She set her lips defiantly, and looked round on the assembled group. This was something she had meant to mention; now she had done it. The informal meeting was aghast. A flavor of robust humor was accustomed to enliven it, but not of a sort to induce dissension. \"There! there! \" murmured Sally Ware. \" It 's the Sabbath day! \" \"Well, nobody 's breakin' of it, as I know of,\" said Mrs. Ellison. Her eyes were brighter than usual, but she composed herself into a careful disregard of annoyance. When desire of news assailed her, she could easily conceal her personal resentments, cannily sacrificing small issues to great. \" I guess there 's no danger o' Parson Bond 's gittin' into the paper, so long 's he behaves himself; but if anybody's got eyes, they can't help seein'. I hadn't been in the Bible class five minutes afore I guessed how he was carryin' on. Has he begun to go with Isabel North, an' his wife not cold in her grave? \" \"Well, I think, for my part, he does want Isabel,\" said Mrs. Robbins sharply, \"an' I say it's a sin an' a shame. Why, she ain't twenty, an' he's sixty if he's a day. My soul! Sally Ware, you better be settin' your cap for my William Henry. He's 'most nineteen. \" Miss Ware flushed, and her plump hands tightened upon each other under her shawl. She was never entirely at ease in the atmosphere of these assured married women; it was always a little bracing. \"Well, how's she take it? \" asked Tilly, turning from one to the other. \"Tickled to death, I s'pose?\" \"Well, I guess she ain't! \" broke in a younger woman, whose wedding finery was not yet outworn. \"She's most sick over it, and so she has been ever since her sister married and went away. I believe she'd hate the sight of him, if 't wasn't the minister; but _'tis_ the minister, and when she's put face to face with him, she can't help saying yes and no. \" \" I dunno',\" said Mrs. Page, with her unctuous laugh. \"Remember the party over to Tiverton t'other night, an' them tarts?",

I believe she'd hate the sight of him, if 't wasn't the minister; but _'tis_ the minister, and when she's put face to face with him, she can't help saying yes and no. \" \" I dunno',\" said Mrs. Page, with her unctuous laugh. \"Remember the party over to Tiverton t'other night, an' them tarts? You see, Rosanna Maria Pike asked us all over; an' you know how flaky her pie-crust is. Well, the minister was stan'in' side of Isabel when the tarts was passed. He was sort o' shinin' up to her that night, an' I guess he felt a mite twittery; so when the tarts come to him, he reached out kind o' delicate, with his little finger straight out, an' tried to take one. An' a ring o' crust come off on his finger. Then he tried it ag'in, an' got another ring. Everybody'd ha' laughed, if it hadn't been the minister; but Isabel she tickled right out, an' says, 'You don't take jelly, do you, Mr. Bond? ' An' he turned as red as fire, an' says, 'No, I thank you. '\" \"She wouldn't ha' said it, if she hadn't ha' been so nervous,\" remarked Miss Sally, taking a little parcel of peppermints from her pocket, and proceeding to divide them. \" No, I don't s'pose she would,\" owned Mrs. Page reflectively. \"But if what they say is true, she's been pretty sassy to him, fust an' last. Why, you know, no matter how the parson begins his prayer, he's sure to end up on one line: 'Lord, we thank Thee we have not been left to live by the dim light of natur'. ' 'Lisha Cole, when he come home from Illinois, walked over here to meetin' , to surprise some o' the folks. He waited in the entry to ketch 'em comin' out, an' the fust word he heard was, 'Lord, we thank Thee we have not been left to live by the dim light of natur'. ' 'Lisha said he'd had time to be shipwrecked (you know he went to California fust an' made the v'yage), an' be married twice, an' lay by enough to keep him, and come home poor; but when he heard that, he felt as if the world hadn't moved sence he started. \" Sally Ware dropped her mitten, to avoid listening and the necessity of reply; it was too evident that the conversational tone was becoming profane. But Mrs. Page 's eyes were gleaming with pure dramatic joy, and she continued:-- \"Well, a fortnight or so ago he went over to see Isabel, an' Sadie an' her husband happened to be there . They were all settin' purrin' in the dark, because they'd forgot to send for any kerosene. 'No light?' says he, hittin' his head ag'inst the chimbly-piece goin' in,--'no light?' 'No,' says Isabel, 'none but the dim light of natur'.'\" There was a chime of delighted laughter in many keys. The company felt the ease of unrestricted speech. They wished the nooning might be indefinitely prolonged. \"Sometimes I think she sets out to make him believe she's wuss 'n she is,\" remarked Mrs. Cole. \"Remember how she carried on, last Sabbath? \" \" I guess so! \" returned Mrs. Page. \"You see, Tilly, he's kind o' pushin' her for'ard to make her seem more suitable,--he'd like to have her as old as the hills!--an' nothin' would do but she must go into the Bible class. Ain't a member that 's under fifty, but there that little young thing sets, cheeks red as a beet, an' the elder asks her questions, when he gits to her, as if he was coverin' on her over with cotton wool . Well, last Sabbath old Deacon Pitts--le's see, there ain't any o' his folks present, be they?--well, he was late, an' he hadn't looked at his lesson besides. 'T was the fust chapter in Ruth, where it begins, 'In the days when the judges ruled. ' You recollect Naomi told the two darters they'd got to set sail, an' then the Bible says, 'they lifted up their voice an' wept. ' 'Who wept? ' says the parson to Deacon Pitts, afore he'd got fairly se'down. The deacon he opened his Bible, an' whirled over the leaves. 'Who wept, Brother Pitts? ' says the parson over ag'in. Somebody found the deacon the place, an' p'inted. He was growin' redder an' redder, an' his spe'tacles kep' slippin' down, but he did manage to see; the chapter begun suthin' about the judges. Well, by that time parson spoke out sort o' sharp. 'Brother Pitts,' says he, 'who wept? ' The deacon see't he'd got to put some kind of a face on't, an' he looked up an' spoke out, as bold as brass. 'I conclude,' says he,--'I conclude 't was the judges! '\" Even Miss Ware smiled a little, and adjusted her gold beads. The others laughed out rich and free. \"Well, what'd that have to do with Isabel? \" asked Mrs. Ellison, who never forgot the main issue. \" Why, everybody else drawed down their faces, an' tried to keep 'em straight, but Isabel, she begun to laugh, an' she laughed till the tears streamed down her cheeks. Deacon Pitts was real put out, for him, an' the parson tried not to take no notice. But it went so fur he couldn't help it, an' so he says, 'Miss Isabel, I'm real pained,' says he. But 'twas jest as you'd cuff the kitten for snarlin' up your yarn. \" \"Well, what 's Isabel goin' to do? \" asked Mrs. Ellison. \"S'pose she'll marry him? \" \" Why, she won't unless he tells her to. If he does, I dunno but she'll think she's got to. \" \" I say it 's a shame,\" put in Mrs. Robbins incisively;",

There, now! I guess I can tell ye. It was sister 'Liza's chist, an' she kep' it up attic. She begun it when we wa'n't more 'n girls goin' to Number Six, an' she's been fillin' on't ever sence. \" \"Begun it! You talk as if 't was a quilt! \" Isabel began to laugh. \"Now don't! \" said her aunt, in great distress. \"Don't ye! I s'pose 't was because we was such little girls an' all when 'Liza started it, but it makes me as nervous as a witch, an' al'ays did. You see, 'Liza was a great hand for deaths an' buryin 's; an' 'as for funerals, she'd ruther go to 'em than eat. I'd say that if she was here this minute, for more 'n once I said it to her face. Well, everybody 't died, she saved suthin' they wore or handled the last thing, an' laid it away in this chist; an' last time I see it opened, 'twas full, an' she kind o' smacked her lips, an' said she should have to begin another. But the very next week she was took away. \" \"Aunt Luceba,\" said Isabel suddenly, \"was aunt Eliza hard to live with? Did you and aunt Mary Ellen have to toe the mark? \" \"Don't you say one word,\" answered her aunt hastily. \"That's all past an' gone. There ain't no way of settlin' old scores but buryin' of 'em. She was older 'n we were, an' on'y a step-sister, arter all. We must think o' that. Well, I must come to the end o' my story, an' then we'll open the chist. Next day arter we laid her away, it come into my head, 'Now we can burn up them things. ' It may ha' been wicked, but there 't was, an' the thought kep' arter me, till all I could think of was the chist; an' byme-by I says to Mary Ellen, one mornin', 'Le's open it to-day an' make a burnfire! ' An' Mary Ellen she turned as white as a sheet, an' dropped her spoon into her sasser, an' she says: 'Not yet! Luceba, don't you ask me to touch it yet. ' An' I found out, though she never'd say another word, that it unset her more'n it did me. One day, I come on her up attic stan'in' over it with the key in her hand, an' she turned round as if I'd ketched her stealin', an' slipped off downstairs. An' this arternoon, she went into Tilly Ellison's with her work, an' it come to me all of a sudden how I'd git Tim Yatter to harness an' load the chist onto the pung, an' I'd bring it over here, an' we'd look it over together ; an' then, if there's nothin' in it but what I think, I'd leave it behind, an' maybe you or Sadie'd burn it. John Cole happened to ride by, and he helped me in with it. I ain't a-goin' to have Mary Ellen worried. She's different from me. She went to school, same 's you have, an' she's different somehow. She's been meddled with all her life, an' I'll be whipped if she sha'n't make a new start. Should you jest as lieves ask Sadie or John?\" \"Why, yes,\" said Isabel wonderingly; \"or do it myself. I don't see why you care. \" Aunt Luceba wiped her beaded face with a large handkerchief. \" I dunno either,\" she owned, in an exhausted voice. \" I guess it 's al'ays little things you can't stand. Big ones you can butt ag'inst. There! I feel better, now I've told ye. Here's the key. Should you jest as soon open it? \" Isabel drew the chest forward with a vigorous pull of her sturdy arm. She knelt before it and inserted the key. Aunt Luceba rose and leaned over her shoulder, gazing with the fascination of horror. At the moment the lid was lifted, a curious odor filled the room . \"My soul! \" exclaimed Aunt Luceba. \" O my soul! \" She seemed incapable of saying more; and Isabel, awed in spite of herself, asked, in a whisper:-- \"What's that smell? I know, but I can't think. \" \" You take out that parcel,\" said aunt Luceba, beginning to fan herself with her handkerchief. \"That little one down there't the end. It's that. My soul! how things come back! Talk about spirits! There 's no need of 'em! _ Things_ are full bad enough! \" Isabel lifted out a small brown paper package, labeled in a cramped handwriting. She held it to the fading light. \"'Slippery elm left by my dear father from his last illness,'\" she read, with difficulty. \"'The broken piece used by him on the day of his death. '\" \"My land! \" exclaimed aunt Luceba weakly. \" Now what'd she want to keep that for? He had it round all that winter, an' he used to give us a little mite, to please us. Oh, dear! it smells like death. Well, le's lay it aside an' git on. The light's goin', an' I must jog along. Take out that dress. I guess I know what 't is, though I can't hardly believe it. \" Isabel took out a black dress, made with a full, gathered skirt and an old-fashioned waist. \"'Dress made ready for aunt Mercy,'\" she read, \"'before my dear uncle bought her a robe. ' But, auntie,\" she added, \"there's no back breadth! \" \"I know it! I know it! She was so large they had to cut it out, for fear 't wouldn't go into the coffin; an' Monroe Giles said she was a real particular woman, an' he wondered how she'd feel to have the back breadth of her quilted petticoat showin' in heaven. I declare I'm 'most sick! What's in that pasteboard box? \" It was a shriveled object, black with long-dried mould. \"'Lemon held by Timothy Marden in his hand just before he died. ' Aunt Luceba,\" said Isabel, turning with a swift impulse, \"I think aunt Eliza was a horror!\" \"Don't you say it, if you do think it,\" said her aunt, sinking into a chair and rocking vigorously. \"Le's git through with it as quick 's we can. Ain't that a bandbox? Yes, that's great-aunt Isabel's leghorn bunnit. You was named for her, you know. An' there's cousin Hattie's cashmere shawl, an' Obed's spe'tacles. An' if there ain't old Mis' Eaton's false front! Don't you read no more. I don't care what they're marked. Move that box a mite. My soul! There 's ma'am 's checked apron I bought her to the fair! Them are all her things down below. \" She got up and walked to the window, looking into the chestnut branches, with unseeing eyes. She turned about presently, and her cheeks were wet. \"There! \" she said; \" I guess we needn't look no more. Should you jest as soon burn 'em? \" \"Yes,\" answered Isabel. She was crying a little, too. \" Of course I will, auntie. I'll put 'em back now. But when you're gone, I'll do it; perhaps not till Saturday, but I will then. \" She folded the articles, and softly laid them away . They were no longer gruesome, since even a few of them could recall the beloved and still remembered dead. As she was gently closing the lid, she felt a hand on her shoulder. Aunt Luceba was standing there, trembling a little, though the tears had gone from her face. \"Isabel,\" said she, in a whisper, \"you needn't burn the apron, when you do the rest. Save it careful. I should like to put it away among my things. \" Isabel nodded. She remembered her grandmother, a placid, hopeful woman, whose every deed breathed the fragrance of godly living. \"There! \" said her aunt, turning away with the air of one who thrusts back the too insistent past, lest it dominate her quite. \" It 's gittin' along towards dark, an I must put for home. I guess that hoss thinks he 's goin' to be froze to the ground. You wrop up my soap-stone while I git on my shawl. Land! don't it smell hot? I wisht I hadn't been so spry about puttin' on't into the oven. \" She hurried on her things; and Isabel, her hair blowing about her face, went out to uncover the horse and speed the departure. The reins in her hands, aunt Luceba bent forward once more to add, \"Isabel, if there's one thing left for me to say, to tole you over to live with us, I want to say it. \" Isabel laughed. \" I know it,\" she answered brightly . \"And if there 's anything I can say to make you and aunt Mary Ellen come over here\"-- Aunt Luceba shook her head ponderously, and clucked at the horse. \"Fur's I'm concerned, it 's settled now. I'd come, an' be glad. But there 's Mary Ellen! Go 'long!",

She threw back the veil, and closed the chest. The parson knocked again. She heard him kicking the snow from his feet against the scraper. It might have betokened a decent care for her floors. It sounded to Isabel like a lover 's haste, and smote her anew with that fear which is the forerunner of action . She blew out the lamp, and lighted a candle. Then she went to the door, schooling herself in desperation to remember this, to remember that, to remember, above all things, that her under dress was red and that her upper one had no back breadth. She threw open the door. \"Good-evening\"--said the parson. He was, about to add \"Miss Isabel,\" but the words stuck in his throat. \"She ain't to home,\" answered Isabel. \" My niece ain't to home. \" The parson had bent forward, and was eyeing her curiously, yet with benevolence. He knew all the residents within a large radius, and he expected, at another word from the shadowy masker, to recognize her also. \" Will she be away long? \" he hesitated. \" I guess she will,\" answered Isabel promptly. \"She ain't to be relied on. I never found her so. \" Her spirits had risen. She knew how exactly she was imitating aunt Luceba's mode of speech. The tones were dramatically exact, albeit of a more resonant quality. \"Auntie's voice is like suet,\" she thought. \"Mine is vinegar. _ But I've got it! _\" A merry devil assailed her, the child of dramatic triumph. She spoke with decision: \" Won't you come in? \" The parson crossed the sill, and waited courteously for her to precede him; but Isabel thought, in time, of her back breadth, and stood aside. \"You go fust,\" said she, \"an' I'll shet the door. \" He made his way into the ill-lighted sitting-room, and began to unpin his shawl. \" I ain't had my bunnit off sence I come,\" announced Isabel, entering with some bustle, and taking her stand, until he should be seated, within the darkest corner of the hearth. \"I've had to turn to an' clear up, or I shouldn't ha' found a spot as big as a hin's egg to sleep in to-night. Maybe you don't know it, but my niece Isabel's got no more faculty about a house'n I have for preachin'--not a mite. \" The parson had seated himself by the stove, and was laboriously removing his arctics.

        "excerpt": "Horn o' the Moon. It is an unshaded, gravelly track, pointing duly up-hill for three long miles; and it has become a sober way to most of us, in this generation : for we never take it unless we go on the solemn errand of getting Mary Dunbar, that famous nurse, to care for our sick or dead. There is a tradition that a summer visitor once hired a \"shay,\" and drove, all by herself, up to Horn o' the Moon, drawn on by the elusive splendor of its name. But she met such a dissuading flood of comment by the way as to startle her into the state of mind commonly associated with the Gully Road. Farmers, haying in the field, came forward, to lean on the fence, and call excitedly,-- \"Where ye goin'? \" \" Horn o' the Moon,\" replied she, having learned in Tiverton the value of succinct replies . \"Who 's sick? \" \"Nobody. \" \"Got any folks up there? \" \" No. Going to see the place. \" The effect of this varied. Some looked in amazement; one ventured to say, \"Well, that's the beater! \" and another dropped into the cabalistic remark which cannot be defined, but which has its due significance, \"Well, you _must_ be sent for! \" The result of all this running commentary was such that, when the visitor reached the top of the hill where Horn o' the Moon lies, encircled by other lesser heights, she was stricken by its exceeding desolation, and had no heart to cast more than a glance at the noble view below. She turned her horse, and trotted, recklessly and with many stumblings, down again into friendly Tiverton. Horn o' the Moon is unique in its melancholy. It has so few trees, and those of so meagre and wind-swept a nature, that it might as well be entirely bald. No apples grow there; and in the autumn, the inhabitants make a concerted sally down into Tiverton Street, to purchase their winter stock, such of them as can afford it. The poorer folk--and they are all poor enough--buy windfalls, and string them to dry; and so common is dried-apple-pie among them that, when a Tivertonian finds this makeshift appearing too frequently on his table, he has only to remark, \"I should think this was Horn o' the Moon!\" and it disappears, to return no more until the slur is somewhat outworn. There is very little grass at the top of the lonely height, and that of a husky, whispering sort, in thin ribbons that flutter low little songs in the breeze. They never cease; for, at Horn o' the Moon, there is always a wind blowing, differing in quality with the season. Sometimes it is a sighing wind from other heights, happier in that they are sweet with firs. Sometimes it is exasperating enough to make the March breezes below seem tender; then it tosses about in snatching gusts, buffeting, and slapping, and excoriating him who stands in its way. Somehow, all the peculiarities of Horn o' the Moon seem referable, in a mysterious fashion, to the wind. The people speak in high, strenuous voices, striving to hold their own against its wicked strength. Most of them are deaf. Is that because the air beats ceaselessly against the porches of their ears? They are a stunted race; for they have grown into the habit of holding the head low, and plunging forward against that battling element. Even the fowl at Horn o' the Moon are not of the ordinary sort. Their feathers grow the wrong way, standing up in a ragged and disorderly fashion; and they, too, have the effect of having been blown about and disarranged, until nature yielded, and agreed to their permanent roughness. Moreover, all the people are old or middle-aged; and possibly that is why, again, the settlement is so desolate. It is a disgrace for us below to marry with Horn o' the Mooners, though they are a sober folk; and now it happens that everybody up there is the cousin of everybody else. The race is dying out, we say, as if we considered it a distinct species; and we agree that it would have been wiped away long ago, by weight of its own eccentricity, had not Mary Dunbar been the making of it. She is the one righteous among many. She is the good nurse whom we all go to seek, in our times of trouble, and she perpetually saves her city from the odium of the world. Mary was born in Tiverton Street. We are glad to remember that, we who condemn by the wholesale, and are assured that no good can come out of Nazareth. When she was a girl of eighteen, her father and mother died; and she fell into a state of spiritual exaltation, wherein she dreamed dreams, and had periods of retirement within her house, communing with other intelligences. We said Mary had lost her mind; but that was difficult to believe, since no more wholesome type of womanhood had ever walked our streets. She was very tall, built on the lines of a beauty transcending our meagre strain. Nobody approved of those broad shoulders and magnificent arms. We said it was a shame for any girl to be so overgrown; yet our eyes followed her, delighted by the harmony of line and action. Then we whispered that she was as big as a moose, and that, if we had such arms, we never'd go out without a shawl. Her \"mittins\" must be wide enough for any man! Mary did everything perfectly. She walked as if she went to meet the morning, and must salute it worthily. She carried a weight as a goddess might bear the infant Bacchus; and her small head, poised upon that round throat, wore the crown of simplicity, and not of pride. But we only told how strong she was, and how much she could lift. We loved Mary, but sensibility had to shrink from those great proportions and that elemental strength. One snowy morning, Mary's spiritual vision called her out of our midst, to which she never came back save as we needed her. The world was very white that day, when she rose, in her still house, dressed herself hastily, and roused a neighbor, begging him to harness, and drive her up to Horn o' the Moon. Folks were sick there, with nobody to take care of them. The neighbor reasoned, and then refused, as one might deny a person, however beloved, who lives by the intuitions of an unseen world. Mary went home again, and, as he believed, to stay. But she had not hesitated in her allegiance to the heavenly voice. Somehow, through the blinding snow and unbroken road, she ploughed her way up to Horn o' the Moon, where she found an epidemic of diphtheria; and there she stayed. We marveled over her guessing how keenly she was needed; but since she never explained, it began to be noised abroad that some wandering peddler told her. That accounted for everything; and Mary had no time for talk. She was too busy, watching with the sick, and going about from house to house, cooking delicate gruels and broiling chicken for those who were getting well. It is said that she even did the barn work, and milked the cows, during that tragic time. We were not surprised. Mary was a great worker, and she was fond of \"creatur's. \" Whether she came to care for these stolid people on the height, or whether the vision counseled her, Mary gave up her house in the village, and bought a little old dwelling under an overhanging hillside, at Horn o' the Moon. It was a nest built into the rock, its back sitting snugly there. The dark came down upon it quickly. In winter, the sun was gone from the little parlor as early as three o'clock ; but Mary did not mind. That house was her temporary shell; she only slept in it in the intervals of hurrying away, with blessed feet, to tend the sick, and hold the dying in untiring arms. I shall never forget how, one morning, I saw her come out of the door, and stand silent, looking toward the rosy east. There was the dawn, and there was she, its priestess, while all around her slept. I should not have been surprised had her lips, parted already in a mysterious smile, opened still further in a prophetic chanting to the sun. But Mary saw me, and the alert, answering look of one who is a messenger flashed swiftly over her face. She advanced like the leader of a triumphal procession. \"Anybody want me? \" she called. \"I'll get my bunnit. \" It was when she was twenty, and not more than settled in the little house at Horn o' the Moon, that her story came to her. The Veaseys were her neighbors, perhaps five doors away; and one summer morning, Johnnie Veasey came home from sea.",

        "excerpt": "Horn o' the Moon. It is an unshaded, gravelly track, pointing duly up-hill for three long miles; and it has become a sober way to most of us, in this generation : for we never take it unless we go on the solemn errand of getting Mary Dunbar, that famous nurse, to care for our sick or dead. There is a tradition that a summer visitor once hired a \"shay,\" and drove, all by herself, up to Horn o' the Moon, drawn on by the elusive splendor of its name. But she met such a dissuading flood of comment by the way as to startle her into the state of mind commonly associated with the Gully Road. Farmers, haying in the field, came forward, to lean on the fence, and call excitedly,-- \"Where ye goin'? \" \" Horn o' the Moon,\" replied she, having learned in Tiverton the value of succinct replies . \"Who 's sick? \" \"Nobody. \" \"Got any folks up there? \" \" No. Going to see the place. \" The effect of this varied. Some looked in amazement; one ventured to say, \"Well, that's the beater! \" and another dropped into the cabalistic remark which cannot be defined, but which has its due significance, \"Well, you _must_ be sent for! \" The result of all this running commentary was such that, when the visitor reached the top of the hill where Horn o' the Moon lies, encircled by other lesser heights, she was stricken by its exceeding desolation, and had no heart to cast more than a glance at the noble view below. She turned her horse, and trotted, recklessly and with many stumblings, down again into friendly Tiverton. Horn o' the Moon is unique in its melancholy. It has so few trees, and those of so meagre and wind-swept a nature, that it might as well be entirely bald. No apples grow there; and in the autumn, the inhabitants make a concerted sally down into Tiverton Street, to purchase their winter stock, such of them as can afford it. The poorer folk--and they are all poor enough--buy windfalls, and string them to dry; and so common is dried-apple-pie among them that, when a Tivertonian finds this makeshift appearing too frequently on his table, he has only to remark, \"I should think this was Horn o' the Moon!\" and it disappears, to return no more until the slur is somewhat outworn. There is very little grass at the top of the lonely height, and that of a husky, whispering sort, in thin ribbons that flutter low little songs in the breeze. They never cease; for, at Horn o' the Moon, there is always a wind blowing, differing in quality with the season. Sometimes it is a sighing wind from other heights, happier in that they are sweet with firs. Sometimes it is exasperating enough to make the March breezes below seem tender; then it tosses about in snatching gusts, buffeting, and slapping, and excoriating him who stands in its way. Somehow, all the peculiarities of Horn o' the Moon seem referable, in a mysterious fashion, to the wind. The people speak in high, strenuous voices, striving to hold their own against its wicked strength. Most of them are deaf. Is that because the air beats ceaselessly against the porches of their ears? They are a stunted race; for they have grown into the habit of holding the head low, and plunging forward against that battling element. Even the fowl at Horn o' the Moon are not of the ordinary sort. Their feathers grow the wrong way, standing up in a ragged and disorderly fashion; and they, too, have the effect of having been blown about and disarranged, until nature yielded, and agreed to their permanent roughness. Moreover, all the people are old or middle-aged; and possibly that is why, again, the settlement is so desolate. It is a disgrace for us below to marry with Horn o' the Mooners, though they are a sober folk; and now it happens that everybody up there is the cousin of everybody else. The race is dying out, we say, as if we considered it a distinct species; and we agree that it would have been wiped away long ago, by weight of its own eccentricity, had not Mary Dunbar been the making of it. She is the one righteous among many. She is the good nurse whom we all go to seek, in our times of trouble, and she perpetually saves her city from the odium of the world. Mary was born in Tiverton Street. We are glad to remember that, we who condemn by the wholesale, and are assured that no good can come out of Nazareth. When she was a girl of eighteen, her father and mother died; and she fell into a state of spiritual exaltation, wherein she dreamed dreams, and had periods of retirement within her house, communing with other intelligences. We said Mary had lost her mind; but that was difficult to believe, since no more wholesome type of womanhood had ever walked our streets. She was very tall, built on the lines of a beauty transcending our meagre strain. Nobody approved of those broad shoulders and magnificent arms. We said it was a shame for any girl to be so overgrown; yet our eyes followed her, delighted by the harmony of line and action. Then we whispered that she was as big as a moose, and that, if we had such arms, we never'd go out without a shawl. Her \"mittins\" must be wide enough for any man! Mary did everything perfectly. She walked as if she went to meet the morning, and must salute it worthily. She carried a weight as a goddess might bear the infant Bacchus; and her small head, poised upon that round throat, wore the crown of simplicity, and not of pride. But we only told how strong she was, and how much she could lift. We loved Mary, but sensibility had to shrink from those great proportions and that elemental strength. One snowy morning, Mary's spiritual vision called her out of our midst, to which she never came back save as we needed her. The world was very white that day, when she rose, in her still house, dressed herself hastily, and roused a neighbor, begging him to harness, and drive her up to Horn o' the Moon. Folks were sick there, with nobody to take care of them. The neighbor reasoned, and then refused, as one might deny a person, however beloved, who lives by the intuitions of an unseen world. Mary went home again, and, as he believed, to stay. But she had not hesitated in her allegiance to the heavenly voice. Somehow, through the blinding snow and unbroken road, she ploughed her way up to Horn o' the Moon, where she found an epidemic of diphtheria; and there she stayed. We marveled over her guessing how keenly she was needed; but since she never explained, it began to be noised abroad that some wandering peddler told her. That accounted for everything; and Mary had no time for talk. She was too busy, watching with the sick, and going about from house to house, cooking delicate gruels and broiling chicken for those who were getting well. It is said that she even did the barn work, and milked the cows, during that tragic time. We were not surprised. Mary was a great worker, and she was fond of \"creatur's. \" Whether she came to care for these stolid people on the height, or whether the vision counseled her, Mary gave up her house in the village, and bought a little old dwelling under an overhanging hillside, at Horn o' the Moon. It was a nest built into the rock, its back sitting snugly there. The dark came down upon it quickly. In winter, the sun was gone from the little parlor as early as three o'clock ; but Mary did not mind. That house was her temporary shell; she only slept in it in the intervals of hurrying away, with blessed feet, to tend the sick, and hold the dying in untiring arms. I shall never forget how, one morning, I saw her come out of the door, and stand silent, looking toward the rosy east. There was the dawn, and there was she, its priestess, while all around her slept. I should not have been surprised had her lips, parted already in a mysterious smile, opened still further in a prophetic chanting to the sun. But Mary saw me, and the alert, answering look of one who is a messenger flashed swiftly over her face. She advanced like the leader of a triumphal procession. \"Anybody want me? \" she called. \"I'll get my bunnit. \" It was when she was twenty, and not more than settled in the little house at Horn o' the Moon, that her story came to her. The Veaseys were her neighbors, perhaps five doors away; and one summer morning, Johnnie Veasey came home from sea.",

        "excerpt": "Horn o' the Moon. It is an unshaded, gravelly track, pointing duly up-hill for three long miles; and it has become a sober way to most of us, in this generation : for we never take it unless we go on the solemn errand of getting Mary Dunbar, that famous nurse, to care for our sick or dead. There is a tradition that a summer visitor once hired a \"shay,\" and drove, all by herself, up to Horn o' the Moon, drawn on by the elusive splendor of its name. But she met such a dissuading flood of comment by the way as to startle her into the state of mind commonly associated with the Gully Road. Farmers, haying in the field, came forward, to lean on the fence, and call excitedly,-- \"Where ye goin'? \" \" Horn o' the Moon,\" replied she, having learned in Tiverton the value of succinct replies . \"Who 's sick? \" \"Nobody. \" \"Got any folks up there? \" \" No. Going to see the place. \" The effect of this varied. Some looked in amazement; one ventured to say, \"Well, that's the beater! \" and another dropped into the cabalistic remark which cannot be defined, but which has its due significance, \"Well, you _must_ be sent for! \" The result of all this running commentary was such that, when the visitor reached the top of the hill where Horn o' the Moon lies, encircled by other lesser heights, she was stricken by its exceeding desolation, and had no heart to cast more than a glance at the noble view below. She turned her horse, and trotted, recklessly and with many stumblings, down again into friendly Tiverton. Horn o' the Moon is unique in its melancholy. It has so few trees, and those of so meagre and wind-swept a nature, that it might as well be entirely bald. No apples grow there; and in the autumn, the inhabitants make a concerted sally down into Tiverton Street, to purchase their winter stock, such of them as can afford it. The poorer folk--and they are all poor enough--buy windfalls, and string them to dry; and so common is dried-apple-pie among them that, when a Tivertonian finds this makeshift appearing too frequently on his table, he has only to remark, \"I should think this was Horn o' the Moon!\" and it disappears, to return no more until the slur is somewhat outworn. There is very little grass at the top of the lonely height, and that of a husky, whispering sort, in thin ribbons that flutter low little songs in the breeze. They never cease; for, at Horn o' the Moon, there is always a wind blowing, differing in quality with the season. Sometimes it is a sighing wind from other heights, happier in that they are sweet with firs. Sometimes it is exasperating enough to make the March breezes below seem tender; then it tosses about in snatching gusts, buffeting, and slapping, and excoriating him who stands in its way. Somehow, all the peculiarities of Horn o' the Moon seem referable, in a mysterious fashion, to the wind. The people speak in high, strenuous voices, striving to hold their own against its wicked strength. Most of them are deaf. Is that because the air beats ceaselessly against the porches of their ears? They are a stunted race; for they have grown into the habit of holding the head low, and plunging forward against that battling element. Even the fowl at Horn o' the Moon are not of the ordinary sort. Their feathers grow the wrong way, standing up in a ragged and disorderly fashion; and they, too, have the effect of having been blown about and disarranged, until nature yielded, and agreed to their permanent roughness. Moreover, all the people are old or middle-aged; and possibly that is why, again, the settlement is so desolate. It is a disgrace for us below to marry with Horn o' the Mooners, though they are a sober folk; and now it happens that everybody up there is the cousin of everybody else. The race is dying out, we say, as if we considered it a distinct species; and we agree that it would have been wiped away long ago, by weight of its own eccentricity, had not Mary Dunbar been the making of it. She is the one righteous among many. She is the good nurse whom we all go to seek, in our times of trouble, and she perpetually saves her city from the odium of the world. Mary was born in Tiverton Street. We are glad to remember that, we who condemn by the wholesale, and are assured that no good can come out of Nazareth. When she was a girl of eighteen, her father and mother died; and she fell into a state of spiritual exaltation, wherein she dreamed dreams, and had periods of retirement within her house, communing with other intelligences. We said Mary had lost her mind; but that was difficult to believe, since no more wholesome type of womanhood had ever walked our streets. She was very tall, built on the lines of a beauty transcending our meagre strain. Nobody approved of those broad shoulders and magnificent arms. We said it was a shame for any girl to be so overgrown; yet our eyes followed her, delighted by the harmony of line and action. Then we whispered that she was as big as a moose, and that, if we had such arms, we never'd go out without a shawl. Her \"mittins\" must be wide enough for any man! Mary did everything perfectly. She walked as if she went to meet the morning, and must salute it worthily. She carried a weight as a goddess might bear the infant Bacchus; and her small head, poised upon that round throat, wore the crown of simplicity, and not of pride. But we only told how strong she was, and how much she could lift. We loved Mary, but sensibility had to shrink from those great proportions and that elemental strength. One snowy morning, Mary's spiritual vision called her out of our midst, to which she never came back save as we needed her. The world was very white that day, when she rose, in her still house, dressed herself hastily, and roused a neighbor, begging him to harness, and drive her up to Horn o' the Moon. Folks were sick there, with nobody to take care of them. The neighbor reasoned, and then refused, as one might deny a person, however beloved, who lives by the intuitions of an unseen world. Mary went home again, and, as he believed, to stay. But she had not hesitated in her allegiance to the heavenly voice. Somehow, through the blinding snow and unbroken road, she ploughed her way up to Horn o' the Moon, where she found an epidemic of diphtheria; and there she stayed. We marveled over her guessing how keenly she was needed; but since she never explained, it began to be noised abroad that some wandering peddler told her. That accounted for everything; and Mary had no time for talk. She was too busy, watching with the sick, and going about from house to house, cooking delicate gruels and broiling chicken for those who were getting well. It is said that she even did the barn work, and milked the cows, during that tragic time. We were not surprised. Mary was a great worker, and she was fond of \"creatur's. \" Whether she came to care for these stolid people on the height, or whether the vision counseled her, Mary gave up her house in the village, and bought a little old dwelling under an overhanging hillside, at Horn o' the Moon. It was a nest built into the rock, its back sitting snugly there. The dark came down upon it quickly. In winter, the sun was gone from the little parlor as early as three o'clock ; but Mary did not mind. That house was her temporary shell; she only slept in it in the intervals of hurrying away, with blessed feet, to tend the sick, and hold the dying in untiring arms. I shall never forget how, one morning, I saw her come out of the door, and stand silent, looking toward the rosy east. There was the dawn, and there was she, its priestess, while all around her slept. I should not have been surprised had her lips, parted already in a mysterious smile, opened still further in a prophetic chanting to the sun. But Mary saw me, and the alert, answering look of one who is a messenger flashed swiftly over her face. She advanced like the leader of a triumphal procession. \"Anybody want me? \" she called. \"I'll get my bunnit. \" It was when she was twenty, and not more than settled in the little house at Horn o' the Moon, that her story came to her. The Veaseys were her neighbors, perhaps five doors away; and one summer morning, Johnnie Veasey came home from sea.",

He's goin' to be like Adam, only wuss. An' I've been down to the Poor Farm, to tell 'em they've got to take him in. \" Her little hands worked; her eager eyes ate their way into the heart. Mary could see exactly how she had had her way with the selectmen. \"I told 'em they'd got to,\" she repeated. \" He ain't got no money, an' we ain't got nuthin', an' have two paraletics on my hands I can't. So they told me they'd give me word to-day; an' I'm goin' down to settle it. I'm in hopes they'll bring me back, an' take him along down. \" \"Yes,\" answered Mary gravely. \"Yes. \" \"Well, now I've come to the beginnin' o' my story. \" Mattie took that last delicious sip of tea at the bottom of the cup. \" He's layin' in bed, an' Adam 's settin' by the stove; an' I wanted to know if you wouldn't run in, long towards noon, an' warm up suthin' for 'em. \" \"Yes, indeed,\" said Mary Dunbar. \"I'll be there. \" She rose, and Mattie, albeit she dearly loved to gossip, felt that she must rise, too, and be on her way. She tried to amplify on what she had already said, but Mary did not seem to be listening; so, treading carefully, lest the dust and dew beset her precious shoes, she took her way down the hill, like a busy little ant, born to scurry and gather . Mary looked hastily about the room, to see if its perfect order needed a farewell touch; and then she drank her cup of tea, and stepped out into the morning. The air was fresh and sweet. She wore no shawl, and the wind lifted the little brown rings on her forehead, and curled them closer. Mary held a hand upon them, and hurried on. She had no more thought of appearances than a woman in a desert land, or in the desert made by lack of praise; for she knew no one looked at her. To be clean and swift was all her life demanded. Adam sat by the stove, where the ashes were still warm. It was not a day for fires, but he loved his accustomed corner. He was a middle-aged man, old with the suffering which is not of years, and the pathos of his stricken state hung about him, from his unkempt beard to the dusty black clothing which had been the Tiverton minister 's outworn suit. One would have said he belonged to the generation before his brother. \"That you, Mary? \" he asked, in his shaking voice. \"Now, ain't that good? Come to set a spell? \" \" Where is he? \" responded Mary, in a swift breathlessness quite new to her. \"In there. We put up a bed in the clock-room. \" It was the unfinished part of the house. The Veaseys had always meant to plaster, but that consummation was still afar. The laths showed meagrely; it was a skeleton of a room,--and, sunken in the high feather-bed between the two windows, lay Johnnie Veasey, his buoyancy all gone, his face quite piteous to see, now that its tan had faded . Mary went up to the bedside, and laid one cool, strong hand upon his wrist. His eyes sought her with a wild entreaty; but she knew, although he seemed to suffer, that this was the misery of delirium, and not the conscious mind. Adam had come trembling to the door, and stood there, one hand beating its perpetual tattoo upon the wall.

        "excerpt": "David Macy's house stood on the spur of a breezy upland at the end of a road. The faraway neighbors, who lived on the main highway and could see the passin', often thanked their stars that they had been called to no such isolation; you might, said they, as well be set down in the middle of pastur'. They wondered how David's Letty could stand it. She had been married 'most a year, and before that she was forever on the go. But there! if David Macy had told her the sun rose in the west, she'd ha' looked out for it there every identical mornin'. The last proposition had some color in it; for Letty was very much in love. To an impartial view, David was a stalwart fellow with clear gray eyes and square shoulders, a prosperous yeoman of the fibre to which America owes her being. But according to Letty he was something superhuman in poise and charm. David had no conception of his heroic responsibilities; nothing could have puzzled him more than to guess how the ideal of him grew and strengthened in her maiden mind, and how her after-worship exalted it into something thrilling and passionate, not to be described even by a tongue more facile than hers. Letty had a vivid nature, capable of responding to those delicate influences which move to spiritual issues. There were throes of love within her, of aspiration, of an ineffable delight in being. She never tried to understand them, nor did she talk about them; but then, she never tried to paint the sky or copy the robin's song. Life was very mysterious; but one thing was quite as mysterious as another. She did sometimes brood for a moment over the troubled sense that, in some fashion, she spoke in another key from \"other folks,\" who did not appear to know that joy is not altogether joy, but three-quarters pain, and who had never learned how it brings its own aching sense of incompleteness; but that only seemed to her a part of the general wonder of things. There had been one strange May morning in her life when she went with her husband into the woods, to hunt up a wild steer. She knew every foot of the place, and yet one turn of the path brought them into the heart of a picture thrillingly new with the unfamiliarity of pure and living beauty. The evergreens enfolded them in a palpable dusk; but entrancingly near, shimmering under a sunny gleam, stood a company of birches in their first spring wear. They were trembling, not so much under the breeze as from the hurrying rhythm of the year. Their green was vivid enough to lave the vision in light; and Letty looked beyond it to a brighter vista still. There, in an opening, lay a bank of violets, springing in the sun. Their blue was a challenge to the skyey blue above; it pierced the sight, awaking new longings and strange memories. It seemed to Letty as if some invisible finger touched her on the heart and made her pause. Then David turned, smiling kindly upon her, and she ran to him with a little cry, and put her arms about his neck. \"What is it? \" he asked, stroking her hair with a gentle hand. \"What is it, little child? \" \"Oh, it 's nothin'! '\" said Letty chokingly. \" It 's only--I like you so! \" The halting thought had no purple wherein to clothe itself ; but it meant as much as if she had read the poets until great words had become familiar, and she could say \"love. \" He was the spring day, the sun, the blue of the sky, the quiver of leaves; and she felt it, and had a pain at her heart. Now, on an autumn morning, David was standing within the great space in front of the barn, greasing the wheels preliminary to a drive to market; and Letty stood beside him, bareheaded, her breakfast dishes forgotten. She was a round thing, with quick movements not ordinarily belonging to one so plump; her black hair was short, and curled roughly, and there were freckles on her little snub nose. David looked up at her red cheeks and the merry shine of her eyes, and smiled upon her. \" You look pretty nice this mornin',\" he remarked. Letty gave a little dancing step and laughed. The sun was bright; there was a purple haze over the hills, and the nearer woods were yellow. The world was a jewel newly set for her. \"I _ am _ nice! \" said she. \"David, do you know our anniversary's comin' on? It's 'most a year since we were married,--a year the fifteenth. \" David loosened the last wheel, and rose to look at her. \" Sho! \" said he, with great interest \" Is that so? Well, 't was a good bargain. Best trade I ever made in _ my _ life! \" \" And we've got to celebrate,\" said Letty masterfully. \"I'll tell you how. I've had it all planned for a month. We'll get up at four, have our breakfast, ride over to Star Pond, and picnic all day long. We'll take a boat and go out rowin', and we'll eat our dinner on the water! \" David smiled back at her, and then, with a sudden recollection, pursed his lips. \"I'm awful sorry, Letty,\" he said honestly, \"but I've got to go over to Long Pastur' an' do that fencin', or I can't put the cattle in there before we turn 'em into the shack. You know that fence was all done up in the spring , but that cussed breachy cow o' Tolman's hooked it down; an' if I wait for him to do it--well, you know what he is! \" \"Oh, you can put off your fencin'! \" cried Letty. \"Only one day! Oh, you can! \" \" I could ' most any other time,\" said David, with reason, \"but here it is 'most Saturday, an' next week the thrashin'-machine's comin'. I'm awful sorry, Letty. I am, honest! \" Letty turned half round like a troubled child, and began grinding one heel into the turf. She was conscious of an odd mortification. It was not, said her heart, that the thing itself was so dear to her; it was only that David ought to want immeasurably to do it. She always put great stress upon the visible signs of an invisible bond, and she would be long in getting over her demand for the unreason of love. David threw down the monkey-wrench, and put an arm about her waist. \"Come, now, you don't care, do you? \" he asked lovingly. \"One day's the same as another, now ain't it? \" \" Is it? \" said Letty, a smile running over her face and into her wet eyes. \"Well, then, le's have Fourth o' July fireworks next Sunday mornin'! \" David looked a little hurt; but that was only because he was puzzled. His sense of humor wore a different complexion from Letty's. He liked a joke, and he could tell a good story, but they must lie within the logic of fun. Letty could put her own interpretation on her griefs, and twist them into shapes calculated to send her into hysterical mirth. \"You see,\" said David soothingly, \"we're goin' to be together as long as we live. It ain't as if we'd got to rake an' scrape an' plan to git a minute alone, as it used to be, now is it? An' after the fencin' 's done, an' the thrashin', an' we've got nothin' on our minds, we'll take both horses an' go to Star Pond. Come, now! Be a good girl!\" The world seemed very quiet because Letty was holding silence, and he looked anxiously down at the top of her head. Then she relented a little and turned her face up to his--her rebellious eyes and unsteady mouth. But meeting the loving honesty of his look, her heart gave a great bound of allegiance, and she laughed aloud. \"There! \" she said. \" Have it so. I won't say another word. _ I _ don't care! \" These were David 's unconscious victories, born, not of his strength or tyranny, but out of the woman 's maternal comprehension, her lavish concession of all the small things of life to the one great code.",

        "excerpt": "David Macy's house stood on the spur of a breezy upland at the end of a road. The faraway neighbors, who lived on the main highway and could see the passin', often thanked their stars that they had been called to no such isolation; you might, said they, as well be set down in the middle of pastur'. They wondered how David's Letty could stand it. She had been married 'most a year, and before that she was forever on the go. But there! if David Macy had told her the sun rose in the west, she'd ha' looked out for it there every identical mornin'. The last proposition had some color in it; for Letty was very much in love. To an impartial view, David was a stalwart fellow with clear gray eyes and square shoulders, a prosperous yeoman of the fibre to which America owes her being. But according to Letty he was something superhuman in poise and charm. David had no conception of his heroic responsibilities; nothing could have puzzled him more than to guess how the ideal of him grew and strengthened in her maiden mind, and how her after-worship exalted it into something thrilling and passionate, not to be described even by a tongue more facile than hers. Letty had a vivid nature, capable of responding to those delicate influences which move to spiritual issues. There were throes of love within her, of aspiration, of an ineffable delight in being. She never tried to understand them, nor did she talk about them; but then, she never tried to paint the sky or copy the robin's song. Life was very mysterious; but one thing was quite as mysterious as another. She did sometimes brood for a moment over the troubled sense that, in some fashion, she spoke in another key from \"other folks,\" who did not appear to know that joy is not altogether joy, but three-quarters pain, and who had never learned how it brings its own aching sense of incompleteness; but that only seemed to her a part of the general wonder of things. There had been one strange May morning in her life when she went with her husband into the woods, to hunt up a wild steer. She knew every foot of the place, and yet one turn of the path brought them into the heart of a picture thrillingly new with the unfamiliarity of pure and living beauty. The evergreens enfolded them in a palpable dusk; but entrancingly near, shimmering under a sunny gleam, stood a company of birches in their first spring wear. They were trembling, not so much under the breeze as from the hurrying rhythm of the year. Their green was vivid enough to lave the vision in light; and Letty looked beyond it to a brighter vista still. There, in an opening, lay a bank of violets, springing in the sun. Their blue was a challenge to the skyey blue above; it pierced the sight, awaking new longings and strange memories. It seemed to Letty as if some invisible finger touched her on the heart and made her pause. Then David turned, smiling kindly upon her, and she ran to him with a little cry, and put her arms about his neck. \"What is it? \" he asked, stroking her hair with a gentle hand. \"What is it, little child? \" \"Oh, it 's nothin'! '\" said Letty chokingly. \" It 's only--I like you so! \" The halting thought had no purple wherein to clothe itself ; but it meant as much as if she had read the poets until great words had become familiar, and she could say \"love. \" He was the spring day, the sun, the blue of the sky, the quiver of leaves; and she felt it, and had a pain at her heart. Now, on an autumn morning, David was standing within the great space in front of the barn, greasing the wheels preliminary to a drive to market; and Letty stood beside him, bareheaded, her breakfast dishes forgotten. She was a round thing, with quick movements not ordinarily belonging to one so plump; her black hair was short, and curled roughly, and there were freckles on her little snub nose. David looked up at her red cheeks and the merry shine of her eyes, and smiled upon her. \" You look pretty nice this mornin',\" he remarked. Letty gave a little dancing step and laughed. The sun was bright; there was a purple haze over the hills, and the nearer woods were yellow. The world was a jewel newly set for her. \"I _ am _ nice! \" said she. \"David, do you know our anniversary's comin' on? It's 'most a year since we were married,--a year the fifteenth. \" David loosened the last wheel, and rose to look at her. \" Sho! \" said he, with great interest \" Is that so? Well, 't was a good bargain. Best trade I ever made in _ my _ life! \" \" And we've got to celebrate,\" said Letty masterfully. \"I'll tell you how. I've had it all planned for a month. We'll get up at four, have our breakfast, ride over to Star Pond, and picnic all day long. We'll take a boat and go out rowin', and we'll eat our dinner on the water! \" David smiled back at her, and then, with a sudden recollection, pursed his lips. \"I'm awful sorry, Letty,\" he said honestly, \"but I've got to go over to Long Pastur' an' do that fencin', or I can't put the cattle in there before we turn 'em into the shack. You know that fence was all done up in the spring , but that cussed breachy cow o' Tolman's hooked it down; an' if I wait for him to do it--well, you know what he is! \" \"Oh, you can put off your fencin'! \" cried Letty. \"Only one day! Oh, you can! \" \" I could ' most any other time,\" said David, with reason, \"but here it is 'most Saturday, an' next week the thrashin'-machine's comin'. I'm awful sorry, Letty. I am, honest! \" Letty turned half round like a troubled child, and began grinding one heel into the turf. She was conscious of an odd mortification. It was not, said her heart, that the thing itself was so dear to her; it was only that David ought to want immeasurably to do it. She always put great stress upon the visible signs of an invisible bond, and she would be long in getting over her demand for the unreason of love. David threw down the monkey-wrench, and put an arm about her waist. \"Come, now, you don't care, do you? \" he asked lovingly. \"One day's the same as another, now ain't it? \" \" Is it? \" said Letty, a smile running over her face and into her wet eyes. \"Well, then, le's have Fourth o' July fireworks next Sunday mornin'! \" David looked a little hurt; but that was only because he was puzzled. His sense of humor wore a different complexion from Letty's. He liked a joke, and he could tell a good story, but they must lie within the logic of fun. Letty could put her own interpretation on her griefs, and twist them into shapes calculated to send her into hysterical mirth. \"You see,\" said David soothingly, \"we're goin' to be together as long as we live. It ain't as if we'd got to rake an' scrape an' plan to git a minute alone, as it used to be, now is it? An' after the fencin' 's done, an' the thrashin', an' we've got nothin' on our minds, we'll take both horses an' go to Star Pond. Come, now! Be a good girl!\" The world seemed very quiet because Letty was holding silence, and he looked anxiously down at the top of her head. Then she relented a little and turned her face up to his--her rebellious eyes and unsteady mouth. But meeting the loving honesty of his look, her heart gave a great bound of allegiance, and she laughed aloud. \"There! \" she said. \" Have it so. I won't say another word. _ I _ don't care! \" These were David 's unconscious victories, born, not of his strength or tyranny, but out of the woman 's maternal comprehension, her lavish concession of all the small things of life to the one great code.",

        "excerpt": "David Macy's house stood on the spur of a breezy upland at the end of a road. The faraway neighbors, who lived on the main highway and could see the passin', often thanked their stars that they had been called to no such isolation; you might, said they, as well be set down in the middle of pastur'. They wondered how David's Letty could stand it. She had been married 'most a year, and before that she was forever on the go. But there! if David Macy had told her the sun rose in the west, she'd ha' looked out for it there every identical mornin'. The last proposition had some color in it; for Letty was very much in love. To an impartial view, David was a stalwart fellow with clear gray eyes and square shoulders, a prosperous yeoman of the fibre to which America owes her being. But according to Letty he was something superhuman in poise and charm. David had no conception of his heroic responsibilities; nothing could have puzzled him more than to guess how the ideal of him grew and strengthened in her maiden mind, and how her after-worship exalted it into something thrilling and passionate, not to be described even by a tongue more facile than hers. Letty had a vivid nature, capable of responding to those delicate influences which move to spiritual issues. There were throes of love within her, of aspiration, of an ineffable delight in being. She never tried to understand them, nor did she talk about them; but then, she never tried to paint the sky or copy the robin's song. Life was very mysterious; but one thing was quite as mysterious as another. She did sometimes brood for a moment over the troubled sense that, in some fashion, she spoke in another key from \"other folks,\" who did not appear to know that joy is not altogether joy, but three-quarters pain, and who had never learned how it brings its own aching sense of incompleteness; but that only seemed to her a part of the general wonder of things. There had been one strange May morning in her life when she went with her husband into the woods, to hunt up a wild steer. She knew every foot of the place, and yet one turn of the path brought them into the heart of a picture thrillingly new with the unfamiliarity of pure and living beauty. The evergreens enfolded them in a palpable dusk; but entrancingly near, shimmering under a sunny gleam, stood a company of birches in their first spring wear. They were trembling, not so much under the breeze as from the hurrying rhythm of the year. Their green was vivid enough to lave the vision in light; and Letty looked beyond it to a brighter vista still. There, in an opening, lay a bank of violets, springing in the sun. Their blue was a challenge to the skyey blue above; it pierced the sight, awaking new longings and strange memories. It seemed to Letty as if some invisible finger touched her on the heart and made her pause. Then David turned, smiling kindly upon her, and she ran to him with a little cry, and put her arms about his neck. \"What is it? \" he asked, stroking her hair with a gentle hand. \"What is it, little child? \" \"Oh, it 's nothin'! '\" said Letty chokingly. \" It 's only--I like you so! \" The halting thought had no purple wherein to clothe itself ; but it meant as much as if she had read the poets until great words had become familiar, and she could say \"love. \" He was the spring day, the sun, the blue of the sky, the quiver of leaves; and she felt it, and had a pain at her heart. Now, on an autumn morning, David was standing within the great space in front of the barn, greasing the wheels preliminary to a drive to market; and Letty stood beside him, bareheaded, her breakfast dishes forgotten. She was a round thing, with quick movements not ordinarily belonging to one so plump; her black hair was short, and curled roughly, and there were freckles on her little snub nose. David looked up at her red cheeks and the merry shine of her eyes, and smiled upon her. \" You look pretty nice this mornin',\" he remarked. Letty gave a little dancing step and laughed. The sun was bright; there was a purple haze over the hills, and the nearer woods were yellow. The world was a jewel newly set for her. \"I _ am _ nice! \" said she. \"David, do you know our anniversary's comin' on? It's 'most a year since we were married,--a year the fifteenth. \" David loosened the last wheel, and rose to look at her. \" Sho! \" said he, with great interest \" Is that so? Well, 't was a good bargain. Best trade I ever made in _ my _ life! \" \" And we've got to celebrate,\" said Letty masterfully. \"I'll tell you how. I've had it all planned for a month. We'll get up at four, have our breakfast, ride over to Star Pond, and picnic all day long. We'll take a boat and go out rowin', and we'll eat our dinner on the water! \" David smiled back at her, and then, with a sudden recollection, pursed his lips. \"I'm awful sorry, Letty,\" he said honestly, \"but I've got to go over to Long Pastur' an' do that fencin', or I can't put the cattle in there before we turn 'em into the shack. You know that fence was all done up in the spring , but that cussed breachy cow o' Tolman's hooked it down; an' if I wait for him to do it--well, you know what he is! \" \"Oh, you can put off your fencin'! \" cried Letty. \"Only one day! Oh, you can! \" \" I could ' most any other time,\" said David, with reason, \"but here it is 'most Saturday, an' next week the thrashin'-machine's comin'. I'm awful sorry, Letty. I am, honest! \" Letty turned half round like a troubled child, and began grinding one heel into the turf. She was conscious of an odd mortification. It was not, said her heart, that the thing itself was so dear to her; it was only that David ought to want immeasurably to do it. She always put great stress upon the visible signs of an invisible bond, and she would be long in getting over her demand for the unreason of love. David threw down the monkey-wrench, and put an arm about her waist. \"Come, now, you don't care, do you? \" he asked lovingly. \"One day's the same as another, now ain't it? \" \" Is it? \" said Letty, a smile running over her face and into her wet eyes. \"Well, then, le's have Fourth o' July fireworks next Sunday mornin'! \" David looked a little hurt; but that was only because he was puzzled. His sense of humor wore a different complexion from Letty's. He liked a joke, and he could tell a good story, but they must lie within the logic of fun. Letty could put her own interpretation on her griefs, and twist them into shapes calculated to send her into hysterical mirth. \"You see,\" said David soothingly, \"we're goin' to be together as long as we live. It ain't as if we'd got to rake an' scrape an' plan to git a minute alone, as it used to be, now is it? An' after the fencin' 's done, an' the thrashin', an' we've got nothin' on our minds, we'll take both horses an' go to Star Pond. Come, now! Be a good girl!\" The world seemed very quiet because Letty was holding silence, and he looked anxiously down at the top of her head. Then she relented a little and turned her face up to his--her rebellious eyes and unsteady mouth. But meeting the loving honesty of his look, her heart gave a great bound of allegiance, and she laughed aloud. \"There! \" she said. \" Have it so. I won't say another word. _ I _ don't care! \" These were David 's unconscious victories, born, not of his strength or tyranny, but out of the woman 's maternal comprehension, her lavish concession of all the small things of life to the one great code.",

Tell him I shall make turnovers to-morrow. \" Debby was thinking of the pork, and the likelihood of its being properly diversified. Letty swept into the barn like a hurrying wind. The horses backed, and laid their ears flat, and David, grooming one of them, gentled him and inquired of him confidentially what was the matter. \"Oh, David, come out here! please come out! \" called Letty breathlessly. \"I've got to see you. \" David appeared, with some wonderment on his face, and Letty precipitated herself upon him, mindless of curry-comb and horse-hairs and the fact that she was presently to do butter. \"David,\" she cried, \"I can't stand it. I've got to tell you. You know this ring? \" David looked at it, interested and yet perplexed. \"Seems if I'd seen you wear it,\" said he. Letty gave way, and laughed hysterically. \"Seems if you had! \" she repeated. \"I've wore it over a year. There ain't a girl in town but knows it. I showed it to 'em all. I told 'em 'twas my engagement ring. \" David looked at it, and then at her. She seemed to him a little mad. He could quiet the horses, but not a woman, in so vague an exigency. \"What made you tell 'em that? \" he asked, at a venture. \"Don't you see? There wasn't one of 'em that was engaged but had a ring--and presents, David--and they knew I never had anything, or I'd have showed 'em. \" David was not a dull man; he had very sound views on the tariff, and, though social questions might thrive outside his world, the town blessed him for an able citizen. But he felt troubled; he was condemned, and it was the world's voice which had condemned him. \"I don't know 's I ever did give you anything, Letty,\" he said, with a new pain stirring in his face. \"I don't b'lieve I ever thought of it. It wasn't that I begrudged anything. \" \" Oh, my soul, no! \" cried Letty, in an agony of her own. \" I knew how 't was. It wa'n't your way, but they didn't know that. And I couldn't have 'em thinkin' what they did think, now could I? So I bought me--David, I bought me that high comb I used to wear, and--and a blue handkerchief--and a thimble--and--and--this ring. And I said you give 'em to me. And I trusted to chance for your never findin' it out. But I always hated the things; and as soon as we were married, I broke the comb, and burnt up the handkerchief, and hammered the thimble into a little wad, and buried it. But I didn't dare to stop wearin' the ring, for fear folks would notice. Then t'other day I felt so about it I knew the time had come, and I went down to the Old Hole and threw it in. And now that hateful Sammy's found it and brought it back, and I've sent him your solder, and Debby's promised me she wouldn't tell you about the pork, and I--I'm no better than the rest of 'em that lie and lie and don't let their men-folks know! \" Letty was sobbing bitterly, and David drew her into his arms and laid his cheek down on her hair. His heart was aching too. They had all the passionate sorrow of children over some grief not understood. \" Why didn't you tell me? \" he asked at length. \"When? \" said Letty chokingly. \"Then--when folks expected things--before we were married. \" \"Oh, David, I couldn't! \" \" No,\" said David sadly, \"I s'pose you couldn't. \" Letty had been holding one hand very tightly clenched. It was a plump hand, with deep dimples and firm, short fingers. She unclasped it, and stretched out toward him a wet, pink palm. \"There! \" she said despairingly. \"There's the ring. \" Again David felt his inadequacy to the situation. \"Don't you want to wear it? \" he hesitated. \" It 's real pretty. What's that red stone? \" \" I hate it! \" cried Letty viciously. \" It 's a garnet. Oh, David, don't you ever let me set eyes on it again! \" David took it slowly from her hand. He drew out his pocket-book, opened it, and dropped the ring inside. \"There! \" he said, \"I guess't won't do me no hurt to come acrost it once in a while. \" Then they kissed each other again, like two children; Letty's tears wet his face, and he felt them bitterer than if they had been his own. But for Letty the air had cleared. Now, she felt, there was no trouble in her path. She had all the irresponsible joy of one who has had a secret, and feels the burden roll away. She was like Christian without his pack. She put her hands on David's shoulders, and looked at him radiantly. \"Oh, I'm so glad! \" she cried. \"I'm just as wicked as I was before; but it don't seem to make any difference, now you know it! \" Though David also smiled, he was regarding her with a troubled wonder. He never expected to follow these varying moods. They were like swallow-flights, and he was content to see the sun upon their wings. So he drove thoughtfully off, and Letty went back to her work with a singing heart. She was not quite sure that it was right to be happy again, all at once, but she could not still her blood. To be forgiven, to find herself free from the haunting consciousness that she could deceive the creature to whom she held such passionate allegiance--this was enough to shape a new heaven and a new earth. Her simple household duties took on the significance of noble ceremonies. She sang as she went about them, and the words were those of a joyous hymn. She seemed to be serving in a temple, making it clean and fragrant in the name of love. Saturday was a day born of heavenly intentions. Letty ran out behind the house, where the ground rose abruptly, and looked off, entranced, into the blue distance. It was the stillest day of all the fall. Not a breath stirred about her; but in the maple grove at the side of the house, where the trees had turned early under the chill of an unseasonable night, yellow leaves were sifting down without a sound. Goldenrod was growing dull, clematis had ripened into feathery spray, and she knew how the closed gentians were painting great purple dashes by the side of the road. \" Oh! \" she cried aloud, in rapture. It was her wedding day; a year ago the sun had shone as warmly and benignantly as he was shining now, and the same haze had risen, like an exhalation, from the hills. She saw a special omen in it, and felt herself the child of happy fortune, to be so mothered by the great blue sky. Then she ran in to give David his breakfast, and tell him, as they sat down, that it was their wedding morning. As she went, she tore a spray of blood-red woodbine from the wall, and bound it round her waist. But David was not ready for breakfast; he was talking with a man at the barn, and half an hour later came hurrying in to his retarded meal. \"I've got to eat an' run,\" said he; \"Job Fisher kep' me. It's about that ma'sh. But the time wa'n't wasted. He'll sell ten acres for twenty dollars less'n he said last week. Too bad to keep you waitin'! You'd ought to eat yours while't was hot. \" Letty, with a little smile all to herself, sat demurely down and poured coffee; this was no time to talk of anniversaries. David ate in haste, and said good-by. \"I'm goin' down the lot to get my withes,\" said he. \" Whilst I'm gone, you put me up a mite o' luncheon, I sha'n't lay off to come home till night. \" \"Oh, David! \" said Letty, with a little cry. Then the same knowing smile crept over her face. \" No, I sha'n't,\" added she willfully. \"I'm goin' to bring it to you. \" \" Fetch me my dinner? Why, it's a mile and a half 'cross lots! I guess you won't! \" \" You go right along, David,\" said Letty decisively. \"I don't want to hear another word. I ain't seen the Long Pastur' this summer, and I'm comin'. Good-by! \" She disappeared down the cellar stairs with the butter-plate poised on a pyramid of dishes, and David, having no time to argue, went off to his work. About ten o'clock Letty took her way down to the Long Pasture; she was a very happy woman, and she could hold her happiness before her face, regarding it frankly and with a full delight.",

Tell him I shall make turnovers to-morrow. \" Debby was thinking of the pork, and the likelihood of its being properly diversified. Letty swept into the barn like a hurrying wind. The horses backed, and laid their ears flat, and David, grooming one of them, gentled him and inquired of him confidentially what was the matter. \"Oh, David, come out here! please come out! \" called Letty breathlessly. \"I've got to see you. \" David appeared, with some wonderment on his face, and Letty precipitated herself upon him, mindless of curry-comb and horse-hairs and the fact that she was presently to do butter. \"David,\" she cried, \"I can't stand it. I've got to tell you. You know this ring? \" David looked at it, interested and yet perplexed. \"Seems if I'd seen you wear it,\" said he. Letty gave way, and laughed hysterically. \"Seems if you had! \" she repeated. \"I've wore it over a year. There ain't a girl in town but knows it. I showed it to 'em all. I told 'em 'twas my engagement ring. \" David looked at it, and then at her. She seemed to him a little mad. He could quiet the horses, but not a woman, in so vague an exigency. \"What made you tell 'em that? \" he asked, at a venture. \"Don't you see? There wasn't one of 'em that was engaged but had a ring--and presents, David--and they knew I never had anything, or I'd have showed 'em. \" David was not a dull man; he had very sound views on the tariff, and, though social questions might thrive outside his world, the town blessed him for an able citizen. But he felt troubled; he was condemned, and it was the world's voice which had condemned him. \"I don't know 's I ever did give you anything, Letty,\" he said, with a new pain stirring in his face. \"I don't b'lieve I ever thought of it. It wasn't that I begrudged anything. \" \" Oh, my soul, no! \" cried Letty, in an agony of her own. \" I knew how 't was. It wa'n't your way, but they didn't know that. And I couldn't have 'em thinkin' what they did think, now could I? So I bought me--David, I bought me that high comb I used to wear, and--and a blue handkerchief--and a thimble--and--and--this ring. And I said you give 'em to me. And I trusted to chance for your never findin' it out. But I always hated the things; and as soon as we were married, I broke the comb, and burnt up the handkerchief, and hammered the thimble into a little wad, and buried it. But I didn't dare to stop wearin' the ring, for fear folks would notice. Then t'other day I felt so about it I knew the time had come, and I went down to the Old Hole and threw it in. And now that hateful Sammy's found it and brought it back, and I've sent him your solder, and Debby's promised me she wouldn't tell you about the pork, and I--I'm no better than the rest of 'em that lie and lie and don't let their men-folks know! \" Letty was sobbing bitterly, and David drew her into his arms and laid his cheek down on her hair. His heart was aching too. They had all the passionate sorrow of children over some grief not understood. \" Why didn't you tell me? \" he asked at length. \"When? \" said Letty chokingly. \"Then--when folks expected things--before we were married. \" \"Oh, David, I couldn't! \" \" No,\" said David sadly, \"I s'pose you couldn't. \" Letty had been holding one hand very tightly clenched. It was a plump hand, with deep dimples and firm, short fingers. She unclasped it, and stretched out toward him a wet, pink palm. \"There! \" she said despairingly. \"There's the ring. \" Again David felt his inadequacy to the situation. \"Don't you want to wear it? \" he hesitated. \" It 's real pretty. What's that red stone? \" \" I hate it! \" cried Letty viciously. \" It 's a garnet. Oh, David, don't you ever let me set eyes on it again! \" David took it slowly from her hand. He drew out his pocket-book, opened it, and dropped the ring inside. \"There! \" he said, \"I guess't won't do me no hurt to come acrost it once in a while. \" Then they kissed each other again, like two children; Letty's tears wet his face, and he felt them bitterer than if they had been his own. But for Letty the air had cleared. Now, she felt, there was no trouble in her path. She had all the irresponsible joy of one who has had a secret, and feels the burden roll away. She was like Christian without his pack. She put her hands on David's shoulders, and looked at him radiantly. \"Oh, I'm so glad! \" she cried. \"I'm just as wicked as I was before; but it don't seem to make any difference, now you know it! \" Though David also smiled, he was regarding her with a troubled wonder. He never expected to follow these varying moods. They were like swallow-flights, and he was content to see the sun upon their wings. So he drove thoughtfully off, and Letty went back to her work with a singing heart. She was not quite sure that it was right to be happy again, all at once, but she could not still her blood. To be forgiven, to find herself free from the haunting consciousness that she could deceive the creature to whom she held such passionate allegiance--this was enough to shape a new heaven and a new earth. Her simple household duties took on the significance of noble ceremonies. She sang as she went about them, and the words were those of a joyous hymn. She seemed to be serving in a temple, making it clean and fragrant in the name of love. Saturday was a day born of heavenly intentions. Letty ran out behind the house, where the ground rose abruptly, and looked off, entranced, into the blue distance. It was the stillest day of all the fall. Not a breath stirred about her; but in the maple grove at the side of the house, where the trees had turned early under the chill of an unseasonable night, yellow leaves were sifting down without a sound. Goldenrod was growing dull, clematis had ripened into feathery spray, and she knew how the closed gentians were painting great purple dashes by the side of the road. \" Oh! \" she cried aloud, in rapture. It was her wedding day; a year ago the sun had shone as warmly and benignantly as he was shining now, and the same haze had risen, like an exhalation, from the hills. She saw a special omen in it, and felt herself the child of happy fortune, to be so mothered by the great blue sky. Then she ran in to give David his breakfast, and tell him, as they sat down, that it was their wedding morning. As she went, she tore a spray of blood-red woodbine from the wall, and bound it round her waist. But David was not ready for breakfast; he was talking with a man at the barn, and half an hour later came hurrying in to his retarded meal. \"I've got to eat an' run,\" said he; \"Job Fisher kep' me. It's about that ma'sh. But the time wa'n't wasted. He'll sell ten acres for twenty dollars less'n he said last week. Too bad to keep you waitin'! You'd ought to eat yours while't was hot. \" Letty, with a little smile all to herself, sat demurely down and poured coffee; this was no time to talk of anniversaries. David ate in haste, and said good-by. \"I'm goin' down the lot to get my withes,\" said he. \" Whilst I'm gone, you put me up a mite o' luncheon, I sha'n't lay off to come home till night. \" \"Oh, David! \" said Letty, with a little cry. Then the same knowing smile crept over her face. \" No, I sha'n't,\" added she willfully. \"I'm goin' to bring it to you. \" \" Fetch me my dinner? Why, it's a mile and a half 'cross lots! I guess you won't! \" \" You go right along, David,\" said Letty decisively. \"I don't want to hear another word. I ain't seen the Long Pastur' this summer, and I'm comin'. Good-by! \" She disappeared down the cellar stairs with the butter-plate poised on a pyramid of dishes, and David, having no time to argue, went off to his work. About ten o'clock Letty took her way down to the Long Pasture; she was a very happy woman, and she could hold her happiness before her face, regarding it frankly and with a full delight.",

        "excerpt": "John. \"Put in ahead, did he? Well, I guess it 's the fust time he ever got round. I'm terrible sorry, Lucy. The children won't think it's any kind of a Thanksgivin' without you. Somehow they've got it into their heads it 's grandma comin'. They can't seem to understand the difference. \" \"Well, you tell 'em I guess grandma 's kind o' pleased for me to plan it as I have,\" said Lucy Ann, almost gayly. Her face wore a strange, excited look. She breathed a little faster. She saw a pleasant way before her and her feet seemed to be tending toward it without her own volition. \"You give my love to 'em. I guess they'll have a proper nice time. \" She lingered about the store until John had gone, and then went forward to the counter. The storekeeper looked at her respectfully. Everybody had a great liking for Lucy Ann. She had been a faithful daughter, and now that she seemed, in so mysterious a way, to be growing like her mother, even men of her own age regarded her with deference. \"Mr. Stevens,\" said she, \"I didn't bring so much money with me as I might if I'd had my wits about me. Should you jest as soon trust me for some Thanksgivin' things? \"Certain,\" replied Jonathan. \"Clean out the store, if you want. Your credit's good. \" He, too, felt the beguilement of the time. \" I want some things,\" repeated Lucy Ann, with determination. \"Some cinnamon an' some mace--there! I'll tell you, while you weigh . \" It seemed to her that she was buying the spice islands of the world; and though the money lay at home in her drawer, honestly ready to pay, the recklessness of credit gave her an added joy. The store had its market, also, at Thanksgiving time, and she bargained for a turkey. It could be sent her, the day before, by some of the neighbors. When she left the counter, her arms and her little basket were filled with bundles. Joshua Harden was glad to take them. \" No, I won't ride,\" said Lucy Ann, \"Much obliged to _you_. Jest leave the things inside the fence. I'd ruther walk. I don't git out any too often. \" She took her way home along the brown road, stepping lightly and swiftly, and full of busy thoughts. Flocks of birds went whirring by over the yellowed fields. Lucy Ann could have called out to them, in joyous understanding, they looked so free. She, too, seemed to be flying on the wings of a fortunate wind. All that week she scrubbed and regulated, and took a thousand capable steps as briskly as those who work for the home-coming of those they love. The neighbors dropped in, one after another, to ask where she was going to spend Thanksgiving. Some of them said, \"Won't you pass the day with us? \" but Lucy Ann replied blithely:-- \"Oh, John's invited me there! \" All that week, too, she answered letters, in her cramped and careful hand; for cousins had bidden her to the feast. Over the letters she had many a troubled pause, for one cousin lived near Ezra, and had to be told that John had invited her; and to three others, dangerously within hail of each, she made her excuse a turncoat, to fit the time. Duplicity in black and white did hurt her a good deal, and she sometimes stopped, in the midst of her slow transcription, to look up piteously and say aloud:-- \"I hope I shall be forgiven! \" But by the time the stamp was on, and the pencil ruling erased , her heart was light again . If she had sinned, she was finding the path intoxicatingly pleasant. Through all the days before the festival, no house exhaled a sweeter savor than this little one on the green. Lucy Ann did her miniature cooking with great seriousness and care. She seemed to be dwelling in a sacred isolation, yet not altogether alone, but with her mother and all their bygone years. Standing at her table, mixing and tasting, she recalled stories her mother had told her, until, at moments, it seemed as if she not only lived her own life, but some previous one, through that being whose blood ran with hers. She was realizing that ineffable sense of possession born out of knowledge that the enduring part of a personality is ours forever, and that love is an unquenched fire, fed by memory as well as hope. On Thanksgiving morning, Lucy Ann lay in bed a little later, because that had been the family custom. Then she rose to her exquisite house, and got breakfast ready, according to the unswerving programme of the day. Fried chicken and mince pie: she had had them as a child, and now they were scrupulously prepared. After breakfast, she sat down in the sunshine, and watched the people go by to service in Tiverton Church. Lucy Ann would have liked going, too; but there would be inconvenient questioning, as there always must be when we meet our kind. She would stay undisturbed in her seclusion, keeping her festival alone. The morning was still young when she put her turkey in the oven, and made the vegetables ready. Lucy Ann was not very fond of vegetables, but there had to be just so many--onions, turnips, and squash baked with molasses--for her mother was a Cape woman, preserving the traditions of dear Cape dishes. All that forenoon, the little house throbbed with a curious sense of expectancy. Lucy Ann was preparing so many things that it seemed as if somebody must surely keep her company; but when dinner-time struck, and she was still alone, there came no lull in her anticipation . Peace abode with her, and wrought its own fair work. She ate her dinner slowly, with meditation and a thankful heart. She did not need to hear the minister 's careful catalogue of mercies received. She was at home; that was enough. After dinner, when she had done up the work, and left the kitchen without spot or stain, she went upstairs, and took out her mother's beautiful silk poplin, the one saved for great occasions, and only left behind because she had chosen to be buried in her wedding gown. Lucy Ann put it on with careful hands, and then laid about her neck the wrought collar she had selected the day before. She looked at herself in the glass, and arranged a gray curl with anxious scrutiny. No girl adorning for her bridal could have examined every fold and line with a more tender care. She stood there a long, long moment, and approved herself. \" It 's a wonder,\" she said reverently. \" It's the greatest mercy anybody ever had. \" The afternoon waned, though not swiftly; for Time does not always gallop when happiness pursues. Lucy Ann could almost hear the gliding of his rhythmic feet. She did the things set aside for festivals, or the days when we have company. She looked over the photograph album, and turned the pages of the \"Ladies' Wreath. \" When she opened the case containing that old daguerreotype, she scanned it with a little distasteful smile, and then glanced up at her own image in the glass, nodding her head in thankful peace. She was the enduring portrait. In herself, she might even see her mother grow very old. So the hours slipped on into dusk, and she sat there with her dream, knowing, though it was only a dream, how sane it was, and good. When wheels came rattling into the yard, she awoke with a start, and John's voice, calling to her in an inexplicable alarm, did not disturb her. She had had her day. Not all the family fates could take it from her now. John kept calling, even while his wife and children were climbing down, unaided, from the great carryall. His voice proclaimed its own story, and Lucy Ann heard it with surprise. \"Lucy! Lucy Ann! \" he cried. \"You here? You show yourself, if you're all right. \" Before they reached the front door, Lucy Ann had opened it and stood there, gently welcoming. \"Yes, here I be,\" said she. \" Come right in, all of ye. Why, if that ain't Ezra, too, an' his folks, turnin' into the lane. When'd you plan it? \" \" Plan it! we didn't plan it! \" said Mary testily. She put her hand on Lucy Ann's shoulder, to give her a little shake; but, feeling mother 's poplin, she forbore. Lucy Ann retreated before them into the house, and they all trooped in after her. Ezra's family, too, were crowding in at the doorway; and the brothers, who had paused only to hitch the horses, filled up the way behind. Mary, by a just self-election, was always the one to speak. \"I declare, Lucy! \" cried she, \"if ever I could be tried with you, I should be now. Here we thought you was at Ezra's, an' Ezra's folks thought you was with us; an' if we hadn't harnessed up, an' drove over there in the afternoon, for a kind of a surprise party, we should ha' gone to bed thinkin' you was somewhere, safe an' sound. An' here you've been, all day long, in this lonesome house! \" \" You let me git a light,\" said Lucy Ann calmly. \"You be takin' off your things, an' se' down. \" She began lighting the tall astral lamp on the table, and its prisms danced and swung. Lucy Ann's delicate hand did not tremble; and when the flame burned up through the shining chimney, more than one started, at seeing how exactly she resembled grandma, in the days when old Mrs. Cummings had ruled her own house. Perhaps it was the royalty of the poplin that enwrapped her; but Lucy Ann looked very capable of holding her own. She was facing them all, one hand resting on the table, and a little smile flickering over her face. \"I s'pose I was a poor miserable creatur' to git out of it that way,\" said she. \" If I'd felt as I do now, I needn't ha' done it. I could ha' spoke up. But then it seemed as if there wa'n't no other way. I jest wanted my Thanksgivin' in my own home, an' so I throwed you off the track the best way I could. I dunno's I lied. I dunno whether I did or not; but I guess, anyway, I shall be forgiven for it. \" Ezra spoke first: \"Well, if you didn't want to come\"-- \" Want to come! \" broke in John. \" Of course she don't want to come!",

She stood there in the biting wind, while he uncovered the horse and drove away. Then she went shaking back to her fire; but it was not altogether from cold. The sense of the consistency of love and youth, the fine justice with which nature was paying an old debt, had raised her to a stature above her own. She stood there under the mantel, and held by it while she trembled. For the first time, her husband had gone utterly out of her life. It was as though he had not been. \" Saturday! \" she said to herself. \" Saturday! Three days till then! \" Next morning, the spring asserted itself,--there came a whiff of wind from the south and a feeling of thaw. The sled-runners began to cut through to the frozen ground, and about the tree-trunks, where thin crusts of ice were sparkling, came a faint musical sound of trickling drops. The sun was regnant, and little brown birds flew cheerily over the snow and talked of nests. Amelia finished her housework by nine o'clock, and then sat down in her low rocker by the south window, sewing in thrifty haste. The sun fell hotly through the panes, and when she looked up, the glare met her eyes. She seemed to be sitting in a golden shower, and she liked it. No sunlight ever made her blink, or screw her face into wrinkles. She throve in it like a rose-tree. At ten o'clock, one of the slow-moving sleds, out that day in premonition of a \"spell o' weather,\" swung laboriously into her yard and ground its way up to the side-door. The sled was empty, save for a rocking-chair where sat an enormous woman enveloped in shawls, her broad face surrounded by a pumpkin hood. Her dark brown front came low over her forehead, and she wore spectacles with wide bows, which gave her an added expression of benevolence. She waved a mittened hand to Amelia when their eyes met, and her heavy face broke up into smiles. \"Here I be! \" she called in a thick, gurgling voice, as Amelia hastened out, her apron thrown over her head. \" Didn't expect me, did ye? Nobody looks for an old rheumatic creatur'. She's more out o' the runnin' 'n a last year's bird's-nest. \" \"Why, aunt Ann! \" cried Amelia, in unmistakable joy. \"I'm tickled to death to see you. Here, Amos, I'll help get her out. \" The driver, a short, thick-set man of neutral, ashy tints and a sprinkling of hair and beard, trudged round the oxen and drew the rocking-chair forward without a word. He never once looked in Amelia's direction, and she seemed not to expect it; but he had scarcely laid hold of the chair when aunt Ann broke forth:-- \"Now, Amos, ain't you goin' to take no notice of 'Melia, no more'n if she wa'n't here? She ain't a bump on a log, nor you a born fool\" Amos at once relinquished his sway over the chair, and stood looking abstractedly at the oxen, who, with their heads low, had already fallen into that species of day-dream whereby they compensate themselves for human tyranny. They were waiting for Amos, and Amos, in obedience to some inward resolve, waited for commotion to cease. \" If ever I was ashamed, I be now! \" continued aunt Ann, still with an expression of settled good-nature, and in a voice all jollity though raised conscientiously to a scolding pitch. \"To think I should bring such a creatur' into the world, an' set by to see him treat his own relations like the dirt under his feet! \" Amelia laughed.

All the habits of a lifetime urged her on to arrange and rearrange, in pursuit of domestic perfection. People used to say, in her first married days, that Ann Doby wasted more time in planning conveniences about her house than she ever saved by them \"arter she got 'em. \" In her active years, she was, in local phrase, \"a driver. \" Up and about early and late, she directed and managed until her house seemed to be a humming hive of industry and thrift. Yet there was never anything too urgent in that sway. Her beaming good-humor acted as a buffer between her and the doers of her will; and though she might scold, she never rasped and irritated. Nor had she really succumbed in the least to the disease which had practically disabled her. It might confine her to a chair and render her dependent upon the service of others, but over it, also, was she spiritual victor. She could sit in her kitchen and issue orders; and her daughter, with no initiative genius of her own, had all aunt Ann's love of \"springin' to it. \" She cherished, besides, a worshipful admiration for her mother; so that she asked no more than to act as the humble hand under that directing head. It was Amos who tacitly rebelled. When a boy in school, he virtually gave up talking, and thereafter opened his lips only when some practical exigency was to be filled. But once did he vouchsafe a reason for that eccentricity. It was in his fifteenth year, as aunt Ann remembered well, when the minister had called; and Amos, in response to some remark about his hope of salvation, had looked abstractedly out of the window. \"I'd be ashamed,\" announced aunt Ann, after the minister had gone,--\"Amos, I _would_ be ashamed, if I couldn't open my head to a minister o' the gospel! \" \" If one head 's open permanent in a house, I guess that fills the bill,\" said Amos, getting up to seek the woodpile. \" I ain't goin' to interfere with nobody else 's contract. \" His mother looked after him with gaping lips, and, for the space of half an hour, spoke no word. To-day she saw before her an alluring field of action; the prospect roused within her energies, never incapable of responding to a spur . \"My soul, 'Melia! \" she exclaimed, looking about the kitchen with a dominating eye, \"how I should like to git hold o' this house! I al'ays did have a hankerin' that way, an' I don't mind tellin' ye. You could change it all round complete. \" \"It 's a good house,\" said Amelia evasively, taking quick, even stitches, but listening hungrily to the voice of outside temptation. It seemed to confirm all the long-suppressed ambitions of her own heart . \"You 're left well on 't,\" continued aunt Ann, her shrewd blue eyes taking on a speculative look. \"I'm glad you sold the stock . A woman never undertakes man's work but she comes out the little end o' the horn. The house is enough, if you keep it nice. Now, you've got that money laid away, an' all he left you besides. You could live in the village, if you was a mind to. \" A deep flush struck suddenly into Amelia's cheek.

        "excerpt": "last rising, and her face flushed. \"Yes,\" she said gently, \"he _was_ good. \" \" But there! \" continued aunt Ann, dismissing all lighter considerations, \"I dunno's that 's any reason why you should bake in a tin kitchen, nor why you should need to heat up the brick oven every week, when 'twas only done to please him, an' he ain't here to know. Now, 'Melia, le's see what you could do. When you got the range in, 'twould alter this kitchen all over. Why don't you tear down that old-fashioned mantelpiece in the fore-room? \" \" I could have a marble one, \" responded Amelia in a low voice. She had taken her sewing again, and she bent her head over it as if she were ashamed. A flush had risen in her cheeks, and her hand trembled. \"Wide marble! real low down! \" confirmed aunt Ann, in a tone of triumph. \"So fur as that goes, you could have a marble-top table. \" She laid down her knitting, and looked about her, a spark of excited anticipation in her eyes. All the habits of a lifetime urged her on to arrange and rearrange, in pursuit of domestic perfection. People used to say, in her first married days, that Ann Doby wasted more time in planning conveniences about her house than she ever saved by them \"arter she got 'em. \" In her active years, she was, in local phrase, \"a driver. \" Up and about early and late, she directed and managed until her house seemed to be a humming hive of industry and thrift. Yet there was never anything too urgent in that sway. Her beaming good-humor acted as a buffer between her and the doers of her will; and though she might scold, she never rasped and irritated. Nor had she really succumbed in the least to the disease which had practically disabled her. It might confine her to a chair and render her dependent upon the service of others, but over it, also, was she spiritual victor. She could sit in her kitchen and issue orders; and her daughter, with no initiative genius of her own, had all aunt Ann's love of \"springin' to it. \" She cherished, besides, a worshipful admiration for her mother; so that she asked no more than to act as the humble hand under that directing head. It was Amos who tacitly rebelled. When a boy in school, he virtually gave up talking, and thereafter opened his lips only when some practical exigency was to be filled. But once did he vouchsafe a reason for that eccentricity. It was in his fifteenth year, as aunt Ann remembered well, when the minister had called; and Amos, in response to some remark about his hope of salvation, had looked abstractedly out of the window. \"I'd be ashamed,\" announced aunt Ann, after the minister had gone,--\"Amos, I _would_ be ashamed, if I couldn't open my head to a minister o' the gospel! \" \" If one head 's open permanent in a house, I guess that fills the bill,\" said Amos, getting up to seek the woodpile. \" I ain't goin' to interfere with nobody else 's contract. \" His mother looked after him with gaping lips, and, for the space of half an hour, spoke no word. To-day she saw before her an alluring field of action; the prospect roused within her energies, never incapable of responding to a spur . \"My soul, 'Melia! \" she exclaimed, looking about the kitchen with a dominating eye, \"how I should like to git hold o' this house! I al'ays did have a hankerin' that way, an' I don't mind tellin' ye. You could change it all round complete. \" \"It 's a good house,\" said Amelia evasively, taking quick, even stitches, but listening hungrily to the voice of outside temptation. It seemed to confirm all the long-suppressed ambitions of her own heart . \"You 're left well on 't,\" continued aunt Ann, her shrewd blue eyes taking on a speculative look. \"I'm glad you sold the stock . A woman never undertakes man's work but she comes out the little end o' the horn. The house is enough, if you keep it nice. Now, you've got that money laid away, an' all he left you besides. You could live in the village, if you was a mind to. \" A deep flush struck suddenly into Amelia's cheek. She thought of Saltash and Laurie Morse. \"I don't want to live in the village,\" she said sharply, thus reproving her own errant mind. \" I like my home. \" \"Law, yes, of course ye do,\" replied aunt Ann easily, returning to her knitting. \" I was only spec'latin'. The land, 'Melia, what you doin' of?

Now, 'Melia, le's see what you could do. When you got the range in, 'twould alter this kitchen all over. Why don't you tear down that old-fashioned mantelpiece in the fore-room? \" \" I could have a marble one, \" responded Amelia in a low voice. She had taken her sewing again, and she bent her head over it as if she were ashamed. A flush had risen in her cheeks, and her hand trembled. \"Wide marble! real low down! \" confirmed aunt Ann, in a tone of triumph. \"So fur as that goes, you could have a marble-top table. \" She laid down her knitting, and looked about her, a spark of excited anticipation in her eyes. All the habits of a lifetime urged her on to arrange and rearrange, in pursuit of domestic perfection. People used to say, in her first married days, that Ann Doby wasted more time in planning conveniences about her house than she ever saved by them \"arter she got 'em. \" In her active years, she was, in local phrase, \"a driver. \" Up and about early and late, she directed and managed until her house seemed to be a humming hive of industry and thrift. Yet there was never anything too urgent in that sway. Her beaming good-humor acted as a buffer between her and the doers of her will; and though she might scold, she never rasped and irritated. Nor had she really succumbed in the least to the disease which had practically disabled her. It might confine her to a chair and render her dependent upon the service of others, but over it, also, was she spiritual victor. She could sit in her kitchen and issue orders; and her daughter, with no initiative genius of her own, had all aunt Ann's love of \"springin' to it. \" She cherished, besides, a worshipful admiration for her mother; so that she asked no more than to act as the humble hand under that directing head. It was Amos who tacitly rebelled. When a boy in school, he virtually gave up talking, and thereafter opened his lips only when some practical exigency was to be filled. But once did he vouchsafe a reason for that eccentricity. It was in his fifteenth year, as aunt Ann remembered well, when the minister had called; and Amos, in response to some remark about his hope of salvation, had looked abstractedly out of the window. \"I'd be ashamed,\" announced aunt Ann, after the minister had gone,--\"Amos, I _would_ be ashamed, if I couldn't open my head to a minister o' the gospel! \" \" If one head 's open permanent in a house, I guess that fills the bill,\" said Amos, getting up to seek the woodpile. \" I ain't goin' to interfere with nobody else 's contract. \" His mother looked after him with gaping lips, and, for the space of half an hour, spoke no word. To-day she saw before her an alluring field of action; the prospect roused within her energies, never incapable of responding to a spur . \"My soul, 'Melia! \" she exclaimed, looking about the kitchen with a dominating eye, \"how I should like to git hold o' this house! I al'ays did have a hankerin' that way, an' I don't mind tellin' ye.

        "excerpt": "last rising, and her face flushed. \"Yes,\" she said gently, \"he _was_ good. \" \" But there! \" continued aunt Ann, dismissing all lighter considerations, \"I dunno's that 's any reason why you should bake in a tin kitchen, nor why you should need to heat up the brick oven every week, when 'twas only done to please him, an' he ain't here to know. Now, 'Melia, le's see what you could do. When you got the range in, 'twould alter this kitchen all over. Why don't you tear down that old-fashioned mantelpiece in the fore-room? \" \" I could have a marble one, \" responded Amelia in a low voice. She had taken her sewing again, and she bent her head over it as if she were ashamed. A flush had risen in her cheeks, and her hand trembled. \"Wide marble! real low down! \" confirmed aunt Ann, in a tone of triumph. \"So fur as that goes, you could have a marble-top table. \" She laid down her knitting, and looked about her, a spark of excited anticipation in her eyes. All the habits of a lifetime urged her on to arrange and rearrange, in pursuit of domestic perfection. People used to say, in her first married days, that Ann Doby wasted more time in planning conveniences about her house than she ever saved by them \"arter she got 'em. \" In her active years, she was, in local phrase, \"a driver. \" Up and about early and late, she directed and managed until her house seemed to be a humming hive of industry and thrift. Yet there was never anything too urgent in that sway. Her beaming good-humor acted as a buffer between her and the doers of her will; and though she might scold, she never rasped and irritated. Nor had she really succumbed in the least to the disease which had practically disabled her. It might confine her to a chair and render her dependent upon the service of others, but over it, also, was she spiritual victor. She could sit in her kitchen and issue orders; and her daughter, with no initiative genius of her own, had all aunt Ann's love of \"springin' to it. \" She cherished, besides, a worshipful admiration for her mother; so that she asked no more than to act as the humble hand under that directing head. It was Amos who tacitly rebelled. When a boy in school, he virtually gave up talking, and thereafter opened his lips only when some practical exigency was to be filled. But once did he vouchsafe a reason for that eccentricity. It was in his fifteenth year, as aunt Ann remembered well, when the minister had called; and Amos, in response to some remark about his hope of salvation, had looked abstractedly out of the window. \"I'd be ashamed,\" announced aunt Ann, after the minister had gone,--\"Amos, I _would_ be ashamed, if I couldn't open my head to a minister o' the gospel! \" \" If one head 's open permanent in a house, I guess that fills the bill,\" said Amos, getting up to seek the woodpile. \" I ain't goin' to interfere with nobody else 's contract. \" His mother looked after him with gaping lips, and, for the space of half an hour, spoke no word. To-day she saw before her an alluring field of action; the prospect roused within her energies, never incapable of responding to a spur . \"My soul, 'Melia! \" she exclaimed, looking about the kitchen with a dominating eye, \"how I should like to git hold o' this house! I al'ays did have a hankerin' that way, an' I don't mind tellin' ye. You could change it all round complete. \" \"It 's a good house,\" said Amelia evasively, taking quick, even stitches, but listening hungrily to the voice of outside temptation. It seemed to confirm all the long-suppressed ambitions of her own heart . \"You 're left well on 't,\" continued aunt Ann, her shrewd blue eyes taking on a speculative look. \"I'm glad you sold the stock . A woman never undertakes man's work but she comes out the little end o' the horn. The house is enough, if you keep it nice. Now, you've got that money laid away, an' all he left you besides. You could live in the village, if you was a mind to. \" A deep flush struck suddenly into Amelia's cheek. She thought of Saltash and Laurie Morse. \"I don't want to live in the village,\" she said sharply, thus reproving her own errant mind. \" I like my home. \" \"Law, yes, of course ye do,\" replied aunt Ann easily, returning to her knitting. \" I was only spec'latin'. The land, 'Melia, what you doin' of? Repairin' an old coat? \" Amelia bent lower over her sewing. \"'Twas his,\" she answered in a voice almost inaudible. \" I put a patch on it last night by lamplight, and when daytime come, I found it was purple. So I'm takin' it off, and puttin' on a black one to match the stuff. \" \"Goin' to give it away? \" \" No, I ain't,\" returned Amelia, again with that sharp, remonstrant note in her voice. \"What makes you think I'd do such a thing as that? \" \"Law, I didn't mean no harm. You said you was repairin' on 't,--that's all. \" Amelia was ashamed of her momentary outbreak. She looked up and smiled sunnily. \"Well, I suppose it _is _ foolish,\" she owned,--\"too foolish to tell. But I've been settin' all his clothes in order to lay 'em aside at last.

The time never'll come when it 's any easier. My soul, 'Melia, how I should like to git up into your chambers!

        "excerpt": "Oldfield told them it was conformable so to do. Some believed him and some did not; but it was known that a MacDonough's Victory tea-set drove him to an almost outspoken rapture, and that the mere mention of the Bay Psalm Book (a copy of which he sought with the haggard fervor of one who worships but has ceased to hope) was enough to make him \"wild as a hawk. \" Old papers, too, drew him by their very mildew; and when his townsfolk were in danger of respecting him too tediously, they recalled these amiable puerilities, drew a breath of relief, and marked his value down. Many facts in his life were not in the least understood, because he never saw the possibility of talking about them. For example, when at the marriage of his son, Young Nick, he made over the farm, and kept his own residence in the little gambrel-roofed house where he had been born, and his father and grandfather before him, the act was, for a time, regarded somewhat gloomily by the public at large. There were Young Nick and his Hattie, living in the big new house, with its spacious piazza and cool green blinds; there the two daughters were born and bred, and the elder of them was married . The new house had its hired girl and man; and meantime the other Nicholas (nobody ever dreamed of calling him Old Nick) was cooking his own meals, and even, of a Saturday, scouring his kitchen floor . It was easy to see in him the pathetic symbol of a bygone generation relegated to the past. A little wave of sympathy crept to his very feet, and then, finding itself unnoted, ebbed away again. Only one village censor dared speak, saying slyly to Young Nick's Hattie:-- \"Ain't no room for grandpa in the new house, is there ? \" Hattie opened her eyes wide at this discovery, though now she realized that echoes of a like benevolence had reached her ears before. She went home very early from the quilting, and that night she said to her husband, as they sat on the doorstone, waiting for the milk to cool:-- \"Nicholas, little things I've got hold of, first an' last, make me conclude folks pity father. Do you s'pose they do? \" Young Nick selected a fat plantain spike, and began stripping the seeds. \"Well, I dunno what for,\" said he, after consideration. \" Father seems to be pretty rugged. \" Hattie was one of those who find no quicker remedy than that of plentiful speech; and later in the evening, she sped over to the little house, across the dewy orchard. Mr. Oldfield had come home only that afternoon, and now he had drawn up at his kitchen table, which was covered by a hand-woven cloth, beautifully ironed, and set with old-fashioned dishes. He had hot biscuits and apple-pie, and the odor of them rose soothingly to Hattie's nostrils, dissipating, for a moment, her consciousness of tragedy and wrong. A man could not be quite forlorn who cooked such \"victuals,\" and sat before them so serenely. \"See here, father,\" said she, with the desperation of speaking her mind for the first time to one from whom she had hitherto kept awesomely remote; \"when we moved into the new house, I dunno's there was any talk about your comin', too. I guess it never entered into our heads you'd do anything but to stick to the old place. An' now, after it 's all past an' gone, the neighbors say\"-- Nicholas Oldfield had been smiling his slight, dry smile . At this point, he took up a knife, and cut a careful triangle of pie. He did all these things as if each one were very important. \"Here, Hattie,\" Said he, \"you taste o' this dried apple. I put a mite o' lemon in. \" Hattie, somehow abashed by the mental impact of the little man, ate her pie meekly, and thenceforth waived the larger issue. All the same, she knew the neighbors \"pitied father,\" and that they would continue to pity him so long as he lived alone in the little peaceful house, doing his own washing and making his own pie. To-night was a duplication of many another when Nicholas Oldfield had turned the corner and come in sight of his own home; but often as it had been repeated, the experience was never the same. Some would have named his springing emotion delight; but it neither quickened his pace nor made him draw his breath the faster. Perhaps he even walked a little more slowly, to enjoy the taste, for he was a saving man. There was the little house, white as paint could make it, and snug in bowering foliage. He noted, with an approving eye, that the dahlias in the front yard, set in stiff nodding rows, were holding their own bravely against the dry fall weather, and that the asters were blooming profusely, purple and pink. A rare softness came over his features when he stepped into the yard; and though he examined the roof critically in passing, it was with the eye of love. He fitted the key in the lock; the sound of its turning made music in his ears, and, setting his foot upon the sill, he was a man for whom that little was enough. Nicholas Oldfield was at home. He laid down his bag, and went, without an instant 's pause, straight through to the sitting-room, and stood before the tall eight-day clock. He put his hand on the woodwork, as if it might have been the shoulder of a friend, and looked up understandingly in its face. \"Well, here we be,\" said he. \"You'd ha' hil' out till mornin', though. \" For wherever he might travel, he always made it a point to be home in time to wind the clocks; and however early he might hurry away again, under stress of some antiquarian impulse, they were left alive and pulsing behind him. There was one in each room, besides the tall eight-day in the parlor, and they were all soft-voiced and leisurely, reminiscent of another age than ours. Though three of them had been inherited, it almost seemed as if Nicholas must have selected the entire company, so harmonious were they, so serenely fitted to the calm decorum of his own desires. In half an hour he had accomplished many things, and his fire sent a spiral breath toward heaven. The dark old kitchen lay open, door and window, to the still opulent sun, and from the pantry and a corner cupboard came gleams of color, to delight the eye. Here were riches, indeed: old India china, an unbroken set of Sheltered Peasant, and, on the top shelf, little mugs and cups of a pink lustre, soft and sweet as flowers. Many a collector had wooed Nicholas Oldfield to part with his china (for the fame of it had spread afar,) but his only response to solicitation was to open the doors more widely on his treasures, remarking, without emphasis:-- \"I guess they might as well stay where they be.",

        "excerpt": "I'd see! \" Nicholas Oldfield stood quite still, obedient to that touch upon his arm. \" It's the name, Mary,\" said he. \"Why, Freeman Henry's a Titcomb! He can't help that. But he needn't think he can buy Oldfield land, an' set up a house there, as if 't was all in the day's work. Why, Mary, I meant to leave that land to you! An' p'raps you won't marry. Nobody knows. Then, 't would stand in the name a mite longer. \" Mary blushed a little, but her eyes never wavered. \" No, gran'ther,\" said she firmly, \"I sha'n't ever marry anybody. \" \"Well, ye can't tell,\" responded Nicholas, with a sigh. \" Ye can't tell. He might take your name if he wanted ye enough; but I should call it a poor tool that would do that. \" He sighed again, as he reached for his hat, and Mary and he went out of the house together, hand in hand. At the gate they parted, and Nicholas took his way to the schoolhouse, where the town fathers were already assembled. Since he passed over it that afternoon, the road had changed, responsive to twilight and the coming dark. Nicholas knew it in all its phases, from the dawn of spring, vocal with the peeping of frogs, to the revery of winter, the silence of snow, and a hopeful glow in the west. Just here, by the barberry bush at the corner, he had stood still under the spell of Northern Lights. That was the night when his wife lay first in Tiverton churchyard; and he remembered, as a part of the strangeness and wonder of the time, how the north had streamed, and the neighboring houses had been rosy red. But at this hour of the brooding, sultry fall, there was a bitter fragrance in the air, and the world seemed tuned to the somnolent sound of crickets, singing the fields to sleep; That one little note brooded over the earth, and all the living things upon it: hovering, and crooning, and lulling them to the rest decreed from of old. The homely beauty of it smote upon him, though it could not cheer. A hideous progress seemed to threaten, not alone the few details it touched, but all the sweet, familiar things of life. Old War-Wool Eaton, in assailing the town 's historic peace, menaced also the crickets and the breath of asters in the air. He was the rampant spirit of an awful change. So, in the bitterness of revolt, Nicholas Oldfield marched on , and stepped silently into the little schoolhouse, to meet his fellows. They were standing about in groups, each laying down the law according to his kind. The doors were wide open, and Nicholas felt as if he had brought in with him the sounds of coming night. They kept him sane, so that he could hold his own, as he might not have done in a room full of winter brightness. \"Hullo! \" cried Caleb Rivers, in his neutral voice. \"Here's Mr. Oldfield. Well, Mr. Oldfield, there 's a good deal on hand. \" \"Called any votes? \" asked Nicholas. \"Well, no,\" said Caleb, scraping his chin. \" I guess we're sort o' takin' the sense o' the meetin'. \" \"Good deal like a quiltin' so fur,\" remarked Brad Freeman indulgently. \"All gab an' no git there! \" \" They tell me,\" said Uncle Eli Pike, approaching Nicholas as if he had something to confide, \"that out west, where they have them new-fangled clocks, they're all lighted up with 'lectricity. \" \" Do they so? \" asked Caleb, but Nicholas returned, with an unwonted fierceness:-- \" Does that go to the right spot with you? Do you want to see a clock-face starin' over Tiverton, like a full moon, chargin' ye to keep Old War-Wool Eaton in memory? \" \"Well, no,\" replied Eli gently, \"I dunno's I do, an' I dunno _but_ I do.\" \"Might set a lantern back' o' the dial, an' take turns lightin' on 't,\" suggested Brad Freeman. \"Might carve out a jack-o'-lantern like Old Eaton's face,\" supplemented Tom O'Neil irreverently. \"Well,\" concluded Rivers, \"I guess, when all 's said and done, we might as well take the clock, an' bell, too. When a man makes a fair offer, it's no more 'n civil to close with it. Ye can't rightly heave it back ag'in. \" \"My argyment is,\" put in Ebenezer Tolman, who knew how to lay dollar by dollar, \"if he's willin' to do one thing for the town, he's willin' to do another. S'pose he offered us a new brick meetin'-house--or a fancy gate to the cemet'ry! Or s'pose he had it in mind to fill in that low land, so 't we could bury there! Why, he could bring the town right up! Or, take it t'other way round; he could put every dollar he 's got into Sudleigh. \" Nicholas Oldfield groaned, but in the stress of voices no one heard him. He slipped about from one group to another, and always the sentiment was the same. A few smiled at Old War-Wool Eaton, who desired so urgently to be remembered, when no one was likely to forget him; but all agreed that it was, at the worst, a harmless and natural folly. \"Let him be remembered,\" said one, with a large impartiality. \"'T won't do us no hurt, an' we shall have the clock an' bell. \" Just as the meeting was called to order, Nicholas Oldfield stole away, and no one missed him. The proceedings began with some animated discussion, all tending one way. Cupidity had entered into the public soul, and everybody professed himself willing to take the clock, lest, by refusing, some golden future should be marred. Let Old Eaton have his way, if thereby they might beguile him into paving theirs. Let the town grow. Talk was very full and free; but when the moment came for taking a vote, an unexpected sound broke roundly on the air. It was the bell of the old church. One! it tolled. Each man looked at his neighbor. Had death entered the village, and they unaware? Two! three! it went solemnly on, the mellow cadence scarcely dying before another stroke renewed it. The sexton was Simeon Pease, a little red-headed man, a hunchback, abnormally strong. Suddenly he rose in amazement. His face looked ashen. \"Suthin's tollin' the bell! \" he gasped. \" The bell's a-tollin' an' _I ain't there_!\" A new element of mystery and terror sprang to life. \" The sax'on 's here! \" whispered one and another. But nobody stirred, for nobody would lose count. Twenty-three! the dead was young. Twenty-four! and so it marched and marched, to thirty and thirty-five. They looked about them, taking a swift inventory of familiar faces, and more than one man felt a tightening about his heart, at thought of the womenfolk at home. The record climbed to middle-age, and tolled majestically beyond it, like a life ripening to victorious close. Sixty! seventy! eighty-one! \" It ain't Pa'son True! \" whispered an awestruck voice. Then on it beat, to the completed century. The women of Tiverton, in afterwards weighing the immobility of their public representatives under this mysterious clangor, dwelt upon the fact with scorn. \"Well, I should think you was smart! \" cried sundry of them in turn. \"Set there like a bump on a log, an' wonder what's the matter! Never heard of anything so numb in all my born days. If I was a man, I guess I'd see! \" It was Brad Freeman who broke the spell, with a sudden thought and cry,-- \"By thunder!",
